## 1. First five questions of any dataset

LoRA freezes the base weights and trains two small low-rank matrices whose product is added to each target layer. You update ~0.1% of the parameters, the checkpoint is megabytes not gigabytes, and you can swap adapters per customer. QLoRA adds 4-bit base weights so a 7B model fits on one consumer GPU.

```python
import numpy as np

d, r = 512, 8                      # full dim vs LoRA rank
rng = np.random.default_rng(0)
W = rng.normal(size=(d, d)) * 0.02  # frozen base weight
A = rng.normal(size=(d, r)) * 0.01  # trainable
B = np.zeros((r, d))                # trainable, starts at zero -> no change at step 0

delta = A @ B
print('base params   ', W.size)
print('lora params   ', A.size + B.size, f'({100 * (A.size + B.size) / W.size:.1f}%)')
print('effective W = W + A@B, shape', (W + delta).shape)
```

**Remember:** Initialise B to zeros so the adapted model starts exactly equal to the base model.

**Common mistake:** Setting rank far too high — you lose the efficiency and gain the overfitting.

## 2. Shape, dtypes, memory

NumPy stores numbers in one contiguous typed block and runs loops in C. Vectorised code (whole-array operations) is often 50-100x faster than a Python `for` loop and reads closer to the maths. Broadcasting stretches smaller shapes to match without copying data.

```python
import numpy as np

a = np.arange(6).reshape(2, 3)
print(a.shape, a.dtype)

b = np.array([10, 20, 30])       # shape (3,)
print(a + b)                     # broadcast over rows

print(a.sum(axis=0))             # column sums
print(a.sum(axis=1))             # row sums
```

**Remember:** `axis=0` collapses rows (down the columns); `axis=1` collapses columns (across a row).

**Common mistake:** Looping over array elements in Python instead of using a vectorised operation.

## 3. Univariate distributions

A distribution says which values are likely. Gaussian for measurement noise, Bernoulli for yes/no, Poisson for counts per interval. Choosing the right one is choosing your loss function: Gaussian likelihood gives MSE, Bernoulli gives cross-entropy.

```python
import numpy as np

rng = np.random.default_rng(0)
normal = rng.normal(loc=0, scale=1, size=10_000)
coin = rng.binomial(n=1, p=0.3, size=10_000)

print('normal mean/std', round(normal.mean(), 3), round(normal.std(), 3))
print('coin heads rate ', coin.mean())
```

**Remember:** Always seed your RNG (`default_rng(0)`) when you want a result someone else can reproduce.

**Common mistake:** Assuming Gaussian for skewed, bounded, or count data and then being surprised by the residuals.

## 4. Bivariate relationships with the target

LoRA freezes the base weights and trains two small low-rank matrices whose product is added to each target layer. You update ~0.1% of the parameters, the checkpoint is megabytes not gigabytes, and you can swap adapters per customer. QLoRA adds 4-bit base weights so a 7B model fits on one consumer GPU.

```python
import numpy as np

d, r = 512, 8                      # full dim vs LoRA rank
rng = np.random.default_rng(0)
W = rng.normal(size=(d, d)) * 0.02  # frozen base weight
A = rng.normal(size=(d, r)) * 0.01  # trainable
B = np.zeros((r, d))                # trainable, starts at zero -> no change at step 0

delta = A @ B
print('base params   ', W.size)
print('lora params   ', A.size + B.size, f'({100 * (A.size + B.size) / W.size:.1f}%)')
print('effective W = W + A@B, shape', (W + delta).shape)
```

**Remember:** Initialise B to zeros so the adapted model starts exactly equal to the base model.

**Common mistake:** Setting rank far too high — you lose the efficiency and gain the overfitting.

## 5. Correlation matrices and their limits

LoRA freezes the base weights and trains two small low-rank matrices whose product is added to each target layer. You update ~0.1% of the parameters, the checkpoint is megabytes not gigabytes, and you can swap adapters per customer. QLoRA adds 4-bit base weights so a 7B model fits on one consumer GPU.

```python
import numpy as np

d, r = 512, 8                      # full dim vs LoRA rank
rng = np.random.default_rng(0)
W = rng.normal(size=(d, d)) * 0.02  # frozen base weight
A = rng.normal(size=(d, r)) * 0.01  # trainable
B = np.zeros((r, d))                # trainable, starts at zero -> no change at step 0

delta = A @ B
print('base params   ', W.size)
print('lora params   ', A.size + B.size, f'({100 * (A.size + B.size) / W.size:.1f}%)')
print('effective W = W + A@B, shape', (W + delta).shape)
```

**Remember:** Initialise B to zeros so the adapted model starts exactly equal to the base model.

**Common mistake:** Setting rank far too high — you lose the efficiency and gain the overfitting.

## 6. Segment analysis by group

LoRA freezes the base weights and trains two small low-rank matrices whose product is added to each target layer. You update ~0.1% of the parameters, the checkpoint is megabytes not gigabytes, and you can swap adapters per customer. QLoRA adds 4-bit base weights so a 7B model fits on one consumer GPU.

```python
import numpy as np

d, r = 512, 8                      # full dim vs LoRA rank
rng = np.random.default_rng(0)
W = rng.normal(size=(d, d)) * 0.02  # frozen base weight
A = rng.normal(size=(d, r)) * 0.01  # trainable
B = np.zeros((r, d))                # trainable, starts at zero -> no change at step 0

delta = A @ B
print('base params   ', W.size)
print('lora params   ', A.size + B.size, f'({100 * (A.size + B.size) / W.size:.1f}%)')
print('effective W = W + A@B, shape', (W + delta).shape)
```

**Remember:** Initialise B to zeros so the adapted model starts exactly equal to the base model.

**Common mistake:** Setting rank far too high — you lose the efficiency and gain the overfitting.

## 7. Time trends in the data

LoRA freezes the base weights and trains two small low-rank matrices whose product is added to each target layer. You update ~0.1% of the parameters, the checkpoint is megabytes not gigabytes, and you can swap adapters per customer. QLoRA adds 4-bit base weights so a 7B model fits on one consumer GPU.

```python
import numpy as np

d, r = 512, 8                      # full dim vs LoRA rank
rng = np.random.default_rng(0)
W = rng.normal(size=(d, d)) * 0.02  # frozen base weight
A = rng.normal(size=(d, r)) * 0.01  # trainable
B = np.zeros((r, d))                # trainable, starts at zero -> no change at step 0

delta = A @ B
print('base params   ', W.size)
print('lora params   ', A.size + B.size, f'({100 * (A.size + B.size) / W.size:.1f}%)')
print('effective W = W + A@B, shape', (W + delta).shape)
```

**Remember:** Initialise B to zeros so the adapted model starts exactly equal to the base model.

**Common mistake:** Setting rank far too high — you lose the efficiency and gain the overfitting.

## 8. Finding data-entry errors

LoRA freezes the base weights and trains two small low-rank matrices whose product is added to each target layer. You update ~0.1% of the parameters, the checkpoint is megabytes not gigabytes, and you can swap adapters per customer. QLoRA adds 4-bit base weights so a 7B model fits on one consumer GPU.

```python
import numpy as np

d, r = 512, 8                      # full dim vs LoRA rank
rng = np.random.default_rng(0)
W = rng.normal(size=(d, d)) * 0.02  # frozen base weight
A = rng.normal(size=(d, r)) * 0.01  # trainable
B = np.zeros((r, d))                # trainable, starts at zero -> no change at step 0

delta = A @ B
print('base params   ', W.size)
print('lora params   ', A.size + B.size, f'({100 * (A.size + B.size) / W.size:.1f}%)')
print('effective W = W + A@B, shape', (W + delta).shape)
```

**Remember:** Initialise B to zeros so the adapted model starts exactly equal to the base model.

**Common mistake:** Setting rank far too high — you lose the efficiency and gain the overfitting.

## 9. Documenting surprises as you go

LoRA freezes the base weights and trains two small low-rank matrices whose product is added to each target layer. You update ~0.1% of the parameters, the checkpoint is megabytes not gigabytes, and you can swap adapters per customer. QLoRA adds 4-bit base weights so a 7B model fits on one consumer GPU.

print('effective W = W + A@B, shape', (W + delta).shape)
```

**Remember:** Initialise B to zeros so the adapted model starts exactly equal to the base model.

**Common mistake:** Setting rank far too high — you lose the efficiency and gain the overfitting.
