# Day 11 — Visualisation with matplotlib

Today's goal: work through **Visualisation with matplotlib** — ten concepts, ten runnable examples, five questions.

| # | Concept |
|--:|---------|
| 1 | Figure and Axes: the object API |
| 2 | Line, scatter and bar plots |
| 3 | Histograms and density |
| 4 | Subplots and shared axes |
| 5 | Labels, titles, legends, annotation |
| 6 | Colour choices that survive printing |
| 7 | Log scales and when to use them |
| 8 | Saving figures for reports |
| 9 | Plotting a model's residuals |
| 10 | Plot first, model second |

## 1. Figure and Axes: the object API

Plot before you model. A histogram exposes skew and outliers, a scatter exposes non-linearity, and a line of residuals exposes a model that is systematically wrong. Five minutes of plotting saves hours of confused tuning.

```python
import matplotlib
matplotlib.use('Agg')          # headless-safe for scripts/CI
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

x = np.random.default_rng(0).normal(size=500)
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.hist(x, bins=30)
ax.set_title('sample distribution')
fig.savefig('hist.png', dpi=120)
print('wrote hist.png')
```

**Remember:** Label the axes. An unlabelled plot is a decoration, not evidence.

**Common mistake:** Judging a model by its accuracy number alone without ever looking at the data.

Practice: open `examples/01_figure_and_axes_the_object_api.py`, predict the output, change one line, predict again.

## 2. Line, scatter and bar plots

Plot before you model. A histogram exposes skew and outliers, a scatter exposes non-linearity, and a line of residuals exposes a model that is systematically wrong. Five minutes of plotting saves hours of confused tuning.

```python
import matplotlib
matplotlib.use('Agg')          # headless-safe for scripts/CI
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

x = np.random.default_rng(0).normal(size=500)
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.hist(x, bins=30)
ax.set_title('sample distribution')
fig.savefig('hist.png', dpi=120)
print('wrote hist.png')
```

**Remember:** Label the axes. An unlabelled plot is a decoration, not evidence.

**Common mistake:** Judging a model by its accuracy number alone without ever looking at the data.

Practice: open `examples/02_line_scatter_and_bar_plots.py`, predict the output, change one line, predict again.

## 3. Histograms and density

Plot before you model. A histogram exposes skew and outliers, a scatter exposes non-linearity, and a line of residuals exposes a model that is systematically wrong. Five minutes of plotting saves hours of confused tuning.

```python
import matplotlib
matplotlib.use('Agg')          # headless-safe for scripts/CI
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

x = np.random.default_rng(0).normal(size=500)
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.hist(x, bins=30)
ax.set_title('sample distribution')
fig.savefig('hist.png', dpi=120)
print('wrote hist.png')
```

**Remember:** Label the axes. An unlabelled plot is a decoration, not evidence.

**Common mistake:** Judging a model by its accuracy number alone without ever looking at the data.

Practice: open `examples/03_histograms_and_density.py`, predict the output, change one line, predict again.

## 4. Subplots and shared axes

Plot before you model. A histogram exposes skew and outliers, a scatter exposes non-linearity, and a line of residuals exposes a model that is systematically wrong. Five minutes of plotting saves hours of confused tuning.

```python
import matplotlib
matplotlib.use('Agg')          # headless-safe for scripts/CI
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

x = np.random.default_rng(0).normal(size=500)
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.hist(x, bins=30)
ax.set_title('sample distribution')
fig.savefig('hist.png', dpi=120)
print('wrote hist.png')
```

**Remember:** Label the axes. An unlabelled plot is a decoration, not evidence.

**Common mistake:** Judging a model by its accuracy number alone without ever looking at the data.

Practice: open `examples/04_subplots_and_shared_axes.py`, predict the output, change one line, predict again.

## 5. Labels, titles, legends, annotation

Plot before you model. A histogram exposes skew and outliers, a scatter exposes non-linearity, and a line of residuals exposes a model that is systematically wrong. Five minutes of plotting saves hours of confused tuning.

```python
import matplotlib
matplotlib.use('Agg')          # headless-safe for scripts/CI
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

x = np.random.default_rng(0).normal(size=500)
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.hist(x, bins=30)
ax.set_title('sample distribution')
fig.savefig('hist.png', dpi=120)
print('wrote hist.png')
```

**Remember:** Label the axes. An unlabelled plot is a decoration, not evidence.

**Common mistake:** Judging a model by its accuracy number alone without ever looking at the data.

Practice: open `examples/05_labels_titles_legends_annotation.py`, predict the output, change one line, predict again.

## 6. Colour choices that survive printing

Plot before you model. A histogram exposes skew and outliers, a scatter exposes non-linearity, and a line of residuals exposes a model that is systematically wrong. Five minutes of plotting saves hours of confused tuning.

```python
import matplotlib
matplotlib.use('Agg')          # headless-safe for scripts/CI
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

x = np.random.default_rng(0).normal(size=500)
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.hist(x, bins=30)
ax.set_title('sample distribution')
fig.savefig('hist.png', dpi=120)
print('wrote hist.png')
```

**Remember:** Label the axes. An unlabelled plot is a decoration, not evidence.

**Common mistake:** Judging a model by its accuracy number alone without ever looking at the data.

Practice: open `examples/06_colour_choices_that_survive_printing.py`, predict the output, change one line, predict again.

## 7. Log scales and when to use them

Plot before you model. A histogram exposes skew and outliers, a scatter exposes non-linearity, and a line of residuals exposes a model that is systematically wrong. Five minutes of plotting saves hours of confused tuning.

```python
import matplotlib

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

x = np.random.default_rng(0).normal(size=500)
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.hist(x, bins=30)
ax.set_title('sample distribution')
fig.savefig('hist.png', dpi=120)
print('wrote hist.png')
```

**Remember:** Label the axes. An unlabelled plot is a decoration, not evidence.

**Common mistake:** Judging a model by its accuracy number alone without ever looking at the data.

Practice: open `examples/07_log_scales_and_when_to_use_them.py`, predict the output, change one line, predict again.

## 8. Saving figures for reports

Plot before you model. A histogram exposes skew and outliers, a scatter exposes non-linearity, and a line of residuals exposes a model that is systematically wrong. Five minutes of plotting saves hours of confused tuning.

```python

x = np.random.default_rng(0).normal(size=500)
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.hist(x, bins=30)
ax.set_title('sample distribution')
fig.savefig('hist.png', dpi=120)
print('wrote hist.png')
```

**Remember:** Label the axes. An unlabelled plot is a decoration, not evidence.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

x = np.random.default_rng(0).normal(size=500)
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.hist(x, bins=30)
ax.set_title('sample distribution')
fig.savefig('hist.png', dpi=120)
print('wrote hist.png')
```

**Remember:** Label the axes. An unlabelled plot is a decoration, not evidence.

**Common mistake:** Judging a model by its accuracy number alone without ever looking at the data.

## What you should be able to do after Day 11

- Explain **Figure and Axes: the object API** to someone else without notes.
- Explain **Line, scatter and bar plots** to someone else without notes.
- Explain **Histograms and density** to someone else without notes.
- Explain **Subplots and shared axes** to someone else without notes.
- Explain **Labels, titles, legends, annotation** to someone else without notes.
- Run every file in `examples/` and predict its output before running it.
- Answer `questions.md` before opening `answers.md`.

Now open `examples/`, run each file, then break it on purpose and fix it.
