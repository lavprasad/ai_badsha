## 1. Goal: grounded answers over your own documents

RAG grounds answers in your documents: chunk, embed, store, retrieve the top-k for the question, and put them in the prompt. Retrieval quality is the whole ballgame — a perfect model answering from the wrong three chunks is still wrong.

```python
import numpy as np

docs = [
    'Refunds are processed within 5 business days.',
    'Our office is in Pune, open 9am to 6pm.',
    'Enterprise plans include a dedicated support engineer.',
]

def fake_embed(text):                       # stand-in for a real embedding model
    rng = np.random.default_rng(abs(hash(text)) % (2 ** 32))
    v = rng.normal(size=32)
    return v / np.linalg.norm(v)

index = np.array([fake_embed(d) for d in docs])
q = fake_embed('how long do refunds take')
top = int(np.argmax(index @ q))
print('retrieved:', docs[top])
print('\\nReal pipeline: chunk 300-800 tokens with overlap -> embed -> ANN index -> rerank -> prompt.')
```

**Remember:** Always show the source of each retrieved chunk in the answer so users can verify it.

**Common mistake:** Chunking blindly at 1000 characters and cutting tables and code blocks in half.

## 2. Ingestion and chunking pipeline

A Pipeline chains preprocessing and the model into one object that fits and predicts as a unit. This is the single best defence against leakage, and it means deployment ships one artefact instead of six loose steps you must remember to repeat.

```python
import numpy as np, pandas as pd
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

df = pd.DataFrame({'age': [25, np.nan, 40, 33], 'city': ['pune', 'delhi', 'pune', 'delhi']})
y = [0, 1, 0, 1]

pre = ColumnTransformer([
    ('num', Pipeline([('imp', SimpleImputer(strategy='median')), ('sc', StandardScaler())]), ['age']),
    ('cat', OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore'), ['city']),
])
model = Pipeline([('pre', pre), ('clf', LogisticRegression())]).fit(df, y)
print(model.predict(df))
```

**Remember:** `handle_unknown='ignore'` stops production crashing on a category you never saw in training.

**Common mistake:** Preprocessing in a notebook and then forgetting one step when writing the serving code.

## 3. Embedding and index construction

An embedding maps text to a dense vector where nearby means similar in meaning. Unlike keyword search, 'car trouble' matches 'engine won't start'. Every RAG system is embeddings plus nearest-neighbour lookup.

```python
import numpy as np

# Toy 3-D 'embeddings' to show the mechanics
vecs = {
    'king':  np.array([0.9, 0.8, 0.1]),
    'queen': np.array([0.9, 0.1, 0.8]),
    'man':   np.array([0.4, 0.9, 0.1]),
    'woman': np.array([0.4, 0.1, 0.9]),
}

def cos(a, b):
    return float(a @ b / (np.linalg.norm(a) * np.linalg.norm(b)))

analogy = vecs['king'] - vecs['man'] + vecs['woman']
best = max(vecs, key=lambda w: cos(analogy, vecs[w]) if w != 'king' else -1)
print('king - man + woman ~', best)
```

**Remember:** Normalise embeddings, then cosine similarity is just a dot product — much faster at scale.

**Common mistake:** Mixing vectors from two different embedding models in one index; the spaces are unrelated.

## 4. Hybrid retrieval with reranking

RAG grounds answers in your documents: chunk, embed, store, retrieve the top-k for the question, and put them in the prompt. Retrieval quality is the whole ballgame — a perfect model answering from the wrong three chunks is still wrong.

```python
import numpy as np

docs = [
    'Refunds are processed within 5 business days.',
    'Our office is in Pune, open 9am to 6pm.',
    'Enterprise plans include a dedicated support engineer.',
]

def fake_embed(text):                       # stand-in for a real embedding model
    rng = np.random.default_rng(abs(hash(text)) % (2 ** 32))
    v = rng.normal(size=32)
    return v / np.linalg.norm(v)

index = np.array([fake_embed(d) for d in docs])
q = fake_embed('how long do refunds take')
top = int(np.argmax(index @ q))
print('retrieved:', docs[top])
print('\\nReal pipeline: chunk 300-800 tokens with overlap -> embed -> ANN index -> rerank -> prompt.')
```

**Remember:** Always show the source of each retrieved chunk in the answer so users can verify it.

**Common mistake:** Chunking blindly at 1000 characters and cutting tables and code blocks in half.

## 5. Grounded generation with citations

RAG grounds answers in your documents: chunk, embed, store, retrieve the top-k for the question, and put them in the prompt. Retrieval quality is the whole ballgame — a perfect model answering from the wrong three chunks is still wrong.

```python
import numpy as np

docs = [
    'Refunds are processed within 5 business days.',
    'Our office is in Pune, open 9am to 6pm.',
    'Enterprise plans include a dedicated support engineer.',
]

def fake_embed(text):                       # stand-in for a real embedding model
    rng = np.random.default_rng(abs(hash(text)) % (2 ** 32))
    v = rng.normal(size=32)
    return v / np.linalg.norm(v)

index = np.array([fake_embed(d) for d in docs])
q = fake_embed('how long do refunds take')
top = int(np.argmax(index @ q))
print('retrieved:', docs[top])
print('\\nReal pipeline: chunk 300-800 tokens with overlap -> embed -> ANN index -> rerank -> prompt.')
```

**Remember:** Always show the source of each retrieved chunk in the answer so users can verify it.

**Common mistake:** Chunking blindly at 1000 characters and cutting tables and code blocks in half.

## 6. Abstention when retrieval is weak

RAG grounds answers in your documents: chunk, embed, store, retrieve the top-k for the question, and put them in the prompt. Retrieval quality is the whole ballgame — a perfect model answering from the wrong three chunks is still wrong.

```python
import numpy as np

docs = [
    'Refunds are processed within 5 business days.',
    'Our office is in Pune, open 9am to 6pm.',
    'Enterprise plans include a dedicated support engineer.',
]

def fake_embed(text):                       # stand-in for a real embedding model
    rng = np.random.default_rng(abs(hash(text)) % (2 ** 32))
    v = rng.normal(size=32)
    return v / np.linalg.norm(v)

index = np.array([fake_embed(d) for d in docs])
q = fake_embed('how long do refunds take')
top = int(np.argmax(index @ q))
print('retrieved:', docs[top])
print('\\nReal pipeline: chunk 300-800 tokens with overlap -> embed -> ANN index -> rerank -> prompt.')
```

**Remember:** Always show the source of each retrieved chunk in the answer so users can verify it.

**Common mistake:** Chunking blindly at 1000 characters and cutting tables and code blocks in half.

## 7. Evaluation set and scoring harness

RAG grounds answers in your documents: chunk, embed, store, retrieve the top-k for the question, and put them in the prompt. Retrieval quality is the whole ballgame — a perfect model answering from the wrong three chunks is still wrong.

```python
import numpy as np

docs = [
    'Refunds are processed within 5 business days.',
    'Our office is in Pune, open 9am to 6pm.',
    'Enterprise plans include a dedicated support engineer.',
]

def fake_embed(text):                       # stand-in for a real embedding model
    rng = np.random.default_rng(abs(hash(text)) % (2 ** 32))
    v = rng.normal(size=32)
    return v / np.linalg.norm(v)

index = np.array([fake_embed(d) for d in docs])
q = fake_embed('how long do refunds take')
top = int(np.argmax(index @ q))
print('retrieved:', docs[top])
print('\\nReal pipeline: chunk 300-800 tokens with overlap -> embed -> ANN index -> rerank -> prompt.')
```

**Remember:** Always show the source of each retrieved chunk in the answer so users can verify it.

**Common mistake:** Chunking blindly at 1000 characters and cutting tables and code blocks in half.

## 8. Cost and latency measurement

RAG grounds answers in your documents: chunk, embed, store, retrieve the top-k for the question, and put them in the prompt. Retrieval quality is the whole ballgame — a perfect model answering from the wrong three chunks is still wrong.

```python
import numpy as np

docs = [
    'Refunds are processed within 5 business days.',
    'Our office is in Pune, open 9am to 6pm.',
    'Enterprise plans include a dedicated support engineer.',
]

def fake_embed(text):                       # stand-in for a real embedding model
    rng = np.random.default_rng(abs(hash(text)) % (2 ** 32))
    v = rng.normal(size=32)
    return v / np.linalg.norm(v)

index = np.array([fake_embed(d) for d in docs])
q = fake_embed('how long do refunds take')
top = int(np.argmax(index @ q))
print('retrieved:', docs[top])
print('\\nReal pipeline: chunk 300-800 tokens with overlap -> embed -> ANN index -> rerank -> prompt.')
```

**Remember:** Always show the source of each retrieved chunk in the answer so users can verify it.

**Common mistake:** Chunking blindly at 1000 characters and cutting tables and code blocks in half.

## 9. Prompt injection hardening

RAG grounds answers in your documents: chunk, embed, store, retrieve the top-k for the question, and put them in the prompt. Retrieval quality is the whole ballgame — a perfect model answering from the wrong three chunks is still wrong.

```python
import numpy as np

docs = [
    'Refunds are processed within 5 business days.',
    'Our office is in Pune, open 9am to 6pm.',
    'Enterprise plans include a dedicated support engineer.',
]

def fake_embed(text):                       # stand-in for a real embedding model
    rng = np.random.default_rng(abs(hash(text)) % (2 ** 32))
    v = rng.normal(size=32)
    return v / np.linalg.norm(v)

index = np.array([fake_embed(d) for d in docs])
q = fake_embed('how long do refunds take')
top = int(np.argmax(index @ q))
print('retrieved:', docs[top])
print('\\nReal pipeline: chunk 300-800 tokens with overlap -> embed -> ANN index -> rerank -> prompt.')
```

**Remember:** Always show the source of each retrieved chunk in the answer so users can verify it.

**Common mistake:** Chunking blindly at 1000 characters and cutting tables and code blocks in half.

## 10. Deploying it behind an API

```

**Remember:** Always show the source of each retrieved chunk in the answer so users can verify it.

**Common mistake:** Chunking blindly at 1000 characters and cutting tables and code blocks in half.
