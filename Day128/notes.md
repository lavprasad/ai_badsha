## 1. Encoder-only: BERT

A transformer block is attention + feed-forward, each wrapped in a residual connection and a LayerNorm. Attention alone is order-blind, so positions are injected explicitly. Encoder-only (BERT) is for understanding, decoder-only (GPT) for generation, encoder-decoder (T5) for translation-shaped tasks.

```python
import numpy as np

def positional_encoding(seq_len, d_model):
    pos = np.arange(seq_len)[:, None]
    i = np.arange(d_model)[None, :]
    angle = pos / np.power(10_000, (2 * (i // 2)) / d_model)
    pe = np.zeros((seq_len, d_model))
    pe[:, 0::2] = np.sin(angle[:, 0::2])
    pe[:, 1::2] = np.cos(angle[:, 1::2])
    return pe

pe = positional_encoding(6, 8)
print(pe.round(2))
print('shape', pe.shape)
```

**Remember:** Block = LayerNorm -> Attention -> add residual -> LayerNorm -> MLP -> add residual. Memorise it.

**Common mistake:** Assuming a bigger context window is free — attention cost grows with the square of sequence length.

Practice: open `examples/01_encoder_only_bert.py`, predict the output, change one line, predict again.

## 2. Masked language modelling

A transformer block is attention + feed-forward, each wrapped in a residual connection and a LayerNorm. Attention alone is order-blind, so positions are injected explicitly. Encoder-only (BERT) is for understanding, decoder-only (GPT) for generation, encoder-decoder (T5) for translation-shaped tasks.

```python
import numpy as np

def positional_encoding(seq_len, d_model):
    pos = np.arange(seq_len)[:, None]
    i = np.arange(d_model)[None, :]
    angle = pos / np.power(10_000, (2 * (i // 2)) / d_model)
    pe = np.zeros((seq_len, d_model))
    pe[:, 0::2] = np.sin(angle[:, 0::2])
    pe[:, 1::2] = np.cos(angle[:, 1::2])
    return pe

pe = positional_encoding(6, 8)
print(pe.round(2))
print('shape', pe.shape)
```

**Remember:** Block = LayerNorm -> Attention -> add residual -> LayerNorm -> MLP -> add residual. Memorise it.

**Common mistake:** Assuming a bigger context window is free — attention cost grows with the square of sequence length.

Practice: open `examples/02_masked_language_modelling.py`, predict the output, change one line, predict again.

## 3. Decoder-only: GPT family

A transformer block is attention + feed-forward, each wrapped in a residual connection and a LayerNorm. Attention alone is order-blind, so positions are injected explicitly. Encoder-only (BERT) is for understanding, decoder-only (GPT) for generation, encoder-decoder (T5) for translation-shaped tasks.

```python
import numpy as np

def positional_encoding(seq_len, d_model):
    pos = np.arange(seq_len)[:, None]
    i = np.arange(d_model)[None, :]
    angle = pos / np.power(10_000, (2 * (i // 2)) / d_model)
    pe = np.zeros((seq_len, d_model))
    pe[:, 0::2] = np.sin(angle[:, 0::2])
    pe[:, 1::2] = np.cos(angle[:, 1::2])
    return pe

pe = positional_encoding(6, 8)
print(pe.round(2))
print('shape', pe.shape)
```

**Remember:** Block = LayerNorm -> Attention -> add residual -> LayerNorm -> MLP -> add residual. Memorise it.

**Common mistake:** Assuming a bigger context window is free — attention cost grows with the square of sequence length.

Practice: open `examples/03_decoder_only_gpt_family.py`, predict the output, change one line, predict again.

## 4. Next-token prediction

A transformer block is attention + feed-forward, each wrapped in a residual connection and a LayerNorm. Attention alone is order-blind, so positions are injected explicitly. Encoder-only (BERT) is for understanding, decoder-only (GPT) for generation, encoder-decoder (T5) for translation-shaped tasks.

```python
import numpy as np

def positional_encoding(seq_len, d_model):
    pos = np.arange(seq_len)[:, None]
    i = np.arange(d_model)[None, :]
    angle = pos / np.power(10_000, (2 * (i // 2)) / d_model)
    pe = np.zeros((seq_len, d_model))
    pe[:, 0::2] = np.sin(angle[:, 0::2])
    pe[:, 1::2] = np.cos(angle[:, 1::2])
    return pe

pe = positional_encoding(6, 8)
print(pe.round(2))
print('shape', pe.shape)
```

**Remember:** Block = LayerNorm -> Attention -> add residual -> LayerNorm -> MLP -> add residual. Memorise it.

**Common mistake:** Assuming a bigger context window is free — attention cost grows with the square of sequence length.

Practice: open `examples/04_next_token_prediction.py`, predict the output, change one line, predict again.

## 5. Encoder-decoder: T5 and BART

A transformer block is attention + feed-forward, each wrapped in a residual connection and a LayerNorm. Attention alone is order-blind, so positions are injected explicitly. Encoder-only (BERT) is for understanding, decoder-only (GPT) for generation, encoder-decoder (T5) for translation-shaped tasks.

```python
import numpy as np

def positional_encoding(seq_len, d_model):
    pos = np.arange(seq_len)[:, None]
    i = np.arange(d_model)[None, :]
    angle = pos / np.power(10_000, (2 * (i // 2)) / d_model)
    pe = np.zeros((seq_len, d_model))
    pe[:, 0::2] = np.sin(angle[:, 0::2])
    pe[:, 1::2] = np.cos(angle[:, 1::2])
    return pe

pe = positional_encoding(6, 8)
print(pe.round(2))
print('shape', pe.shape)
```

**Remember:** Block = LayerNorm -> Attention -> add residual -> LayerNorm -> MLP -> add residual. Memorise it.

**Common mistake:** Assuming a bigger context window is free — attention cost grows with the square of sequence length.

Practice: open `examples/05_encoder_decoder_t5_and_bart.py`, predict the output, change one line, predict again.

## 6. Span corruption objectives

A transformer block is attention + feed-forward, each wrapped in a residual connection and a LayerNorm. Attention alone is order-blind, so positions are injected explicitly. Encoder-only (BERT) is for understanding, decoder-only (GPT) for generation, encoder-decoder (T5) for translation-shaped tasks.

```python
import numpy as np

def positional_encoding(seq_len, d_model):
    pos = np.arange(seq_len)[:, None]
    i = np.arange(d_model)[None, :]
    angle = pos / np.power(10_000, (2 * (i // 2)) / d_model)
    pe = np.zeros((seq_len, d_model))
    pe[:, 0::2] = np.sin(angle[:, 0::2])
    pe[:, 1::2] = np.cos(angle[:, 1::2])
    return pe

pe = positional_encoding(6, 8)
print(pe.round(2))
print('shape', pe.shape)
```

**Remember:** Block = LayerNorm -> Attention -> add residual -> LayerNorm -> MLP -> add residual. Memorise it.
