## 1. Structure-aware chunking

RAG grounds answers in your documents: chunk, embed, store, retrieve the top-k for the question, and put them in the prompt. Retrieval quality is the whole ballgame — a perfect model answering from the wrong three chunks is still wrong.

```python
import numpy as np

docs = [
    'Refunds are processed within 5 business days.',
    'Our office is in Pune, open 9am to 6pm.',
    'Enterprise plans include a dedicated support engineer.',
]

def fake_embed(text):                       # stand-in for a real embedding model
    rng = np.random.default_rng(abs(hash(text)) % (2 ** 32))
    v = rng.normal(size=32)
    return v / np.linalg.norm(v)

index = np.array([fake_embed(d) for d in docs])
q = fake_embed('how long do refunds take')
top = int(np.argmax(index @ q))
print('retrieved:', docs[top])
print('\\nReal pipeline: chunk 300-800 tokens with overlap -> embed -> ANN index -> rerank -> prompt.')
```

**Remember:** Always show the source of each retrieved chunk in the answer so users can verify it.

**Common mistake:** Chunking blindly at 1000 characters and cutting tables and code blocks in half.

## 2. Heading hierarchy as context

RAG grounds answers in your documents: chunk, embed, store, retrieve the top-k for the question, and put them in the prompt. Retrieval quality is the whole ballgame — a perfect model answering from the wrong three chunks is still wrong.

```python
import numpy as np

docs = [
    'Refunds are processed within 5 business days.',
    'Our office is in Pune, open 9am to 6pm.',
    'Enterprise plans include a dedicated support engineer.',
]

def fake_embed(text):                       # stand-in for a real embedding model
    rng = np.random.default_rng(abs(hash(text)) % (2 ** 32))
    v = rng.normal(size=32)
    return v / np.linalg.norm(v)

index = np.array([fake_embed(d) for d in docs])
q = fake_embed('how long do refunds take')
top = int(np.argmax(index @ q))
print('retrieved:', docs[top])
print('\\nReal pipeline: chunk 300-800 tokens with overlap -> embed -> ANN index -> rerank -> prompt.')
```

**Remember:** Always show the source of each retrieved chunk in the answer so users can verify it.

**Common mistake:** Chunking blindly at 1000 characters and cutting tables and code blocks in half.

## 3. PDF parsing pitfalls

RAG grounds answers in your documents: chunk, embed, store, retrieve the top-k for the question, and put them in the prompt. Retrieval quality is the whole ballgame — a perfect model answering from the wrong three chunks is still wrong.

```python
import numpy as np

docs = [
    'Refunds are processed within 5 business days.',
    'Our office is in Pune, open 9am to 6pm.',
    'Enterprise plans include a dedicated support engineer.',
]

def fake_embed(text):                       # stand-in for a real embedding model
    rng = np.random.default_rng(abs(hash(text)) % (2 ** 32))
    v = rng.normal(size=32)
    return v / np.linalg.norm(v)

index = np.array([fake_embed(d) for d in docs])
q = fake_embed('how long do refunds take')
top = int(np.argmax(index @ q))
print('retrieved:', docs[top])
print('\\nReal pipeline: chunk 300-800 tokens with overlap -> embed -> ANN index -> rerank -> prompt.')
```

**Remember:** Always show the source of each retrieved chunk in the answer so users can verify it.

**Common mistake:** Chunking blindly at 1000 characters and cutting tables and code blocks in half.

## 4. Tables, figures and captions

RAG grounds answers in your documents: chunk, embed, store, retrieve the top-k for the question, and put them in the prompt. Retrieval quality is the whole ballgame — a perfect model answering from the wrong three chunks is still wrong.

```python
import numpy as np

docs = [
    'Refunds are processed within 5 business days.',
    'Our office is in Pune, open 9am to 6pm.',
    'Enterprise plans include a dedicated support engineer.',
]

def fake_embed(text):                       # stand-in for a real embedding model
    rng = np.random.default_rng(abs(hash(text)) % (2 ** 32))
    v = rng.normal(size=32)
    return v / np.linalg.norm(v)

index = np.array([fake_embed(d) for d in docs])
q = fake_embed('how long do refunds take')
top = int(np.argmax(index @ q))
print('retrieved:', docs[top])
print('\\nReal pipeline: chunk 300-800 tokens with overlap -> embed -> ANN index -> rerank -> prompt.')
```

**Remember:** Always show the source of each retrieved chunk in the answer so users can verify it.

**Common mistake:** Chunking blindly at 1000 characters and cutting tables and code blocks in half.

## 5. Code and config files

RAG grounds answers in your documents: chunk, embed, store, retrieve the top-k for the question, and put them in the prompt. Retrieval quality is the whole ballgame — a perfect model answering from the wrong three chunks is still wrong.

```python
import numpy as np

docs = [
    'Refunds are processed within 5 business days.',
    'Our office is in Pune, open 9am to 6pm.',
    'Enterprise plans include a dedicated support engineer.',
]

def fake_embed(text):                       # stand-in for a real embedding model
    rng = np.random.default_rng(abs(hash(text)) % (2 ** 32))
    v = rng.normal(size=32)
    return v / np.linalg.norm(v)

index = np.array([fake_embed(d) for d in docs])
q = fake_embed('how long do refunds take')
top = int(np.argmax(index @ q))
print('retrieved:', docs[top])
print('\\nReal pipeline: chunk 300-800 tokens with overlap -> embed -> ANN index -> rerank -> prompt.')
```

**Remember:** Always show the source of each retrieved chunk in the answer so users can verify it.

**Common mistake:** Chunking blindly at 1000 characters and cutting tables and code blocks in half.

## 6. Contextual chunk headers

RAG grounds answers in your documents: chunk, embed, store, retrieve the top-k for the question, and put them in the prompt. Retrieval quality is the whole ballgame — a perfect model answering from the wrong three chunks is still wrong.

```python
import numpy as np

docs = [
    'Refunds are processed within 5 business days.',
    'Our office is in Pune, open 9am to 6pm.',
    'Enterprise plans include a dedicated support engineer.',
]

def fake_embed(text):                       # stand-in for a real embedding model
    rng = np.random.default_rng(abs(hash(text)) % (2 ** 32))
    v = rng.normal(size=32)
    return v / np.linalg.norm(v)

index = np.array([fake_embed(d) for d in docs])
q = fake_embed('how long do refunds take')
top = int(np.argmax(index @ q))
print('retrieved:', docs[top])
print('\\nReal pipeline: chunk 300-800 tokens with overlap -> embed -> ANN index -> rerank -> prompt.')
```

**Remember:** Always show the source of each retrieved chunk in the answer so users can verify it.

**Common mistake:** Chunking blindly at 1000 characters and cutting tables and code blocks in half.

## 7. Parent-document retrieval

RAG grounds answers in your documents: chunk, embed, store, retrieve the top-k for the question, and put them in the prompt. Retrieval quality is the whole ballgame — a perfect model answering from the wrong three chunks is still wrong.

```python
import numpy as np

docs = [
    'Refunds are processed within 5 business days.',
    'Our office is in Pune, open 9am to 6pm.',
    'Enterprise plans include a dedicated support engineer.',
]

def fake_embed(text):                       # stand-in for a real embedding model
    rng = np.random.default_rng(abs(hash(text)) % (2 ** 32))
    v = rng.normal(size=32)
    return v / np.linalg.norm(v)

index = np.array([fake_embed(d) for d in docs])
q = fake_embed('how long do refunds take')
top = int(np.argmax(index @ q))
print('retrieved:', docs[top])
print('\\nReal pipeline: chunk 300-800 tokens with overlap -> embed -> ANN index -> rerank -> prompt.')
```

**Remember:** Always show the source of each retrieved chunk in the answer so users can verify it.

**Common mistake:** Chunking blindly at 1000 characters and cutting tables and code blocks in half.

## 8. Deduplication in the index

RAG grounds answers in your documents: chunk, embed, store, retrieve the top-k for the question, and put them in the prompt. Retrieval quality is the whole ballgame — a perfect model answering from the wrong three chunks is still wrong.

```python
import numpy as np

docs = [
    'Refunds are processed within 5 business days.',
    'Our office is in Pune, open 9am to 6pm.',
    'Enterprise plans include a dedicated support engineer.',
]

def fake_embed(text):                       # stand-in for a real embedding model
    rng = np.random.default_rng(abs(hash(text)) % (2 ** 32))
    v = rng.normal(size=32)
    return v / np.linalg.norm(v)

index = np.array([fake_embed(d) for d in docs])
q = fake_embed('how long do refunds take')
top = int(np.argmax(index @ q))
print('retrieved:', docs[top])
print('\\nReal pipeline: chunk 300-800 tokens with overlap -> embed -> ANN index -> rerank -> prompt.')
```

**Remember:** Always show the source of each retrieved chunk in the answer so users can verify it.

**Common mistake:** Chunking blindly at 1000 characters and cutting tables and code blocks in half.

## 9. Incremental index updates

RAG grounds answers in your documents: chunk, embed, store, retrieve the top-k for the question, and put them in the prompt. Retrieval quality is the whole ballgame — a perfect model answering from the wrong three chunks is still wrong.

```python
import numpy as np

docs = [
    'Refunds are processed within 5 business days.',
    'Our office is in Pune, open 9am to 6pm.',
    'Enterprise plans include a dedicated support engineer.',
]

def fake_embed(text):                       # stand-in for a real embedding model
    rng = np.random.default_rng(abs(hash(text)) % (2 ** 32))
    v = rng.normal(size=32)
    return v / np.linalg.norm(v)

index = np.array([fake_embed(d) for d in docs])
q = fake_embed('how long do refunds take')
top = int(np.argmax(index @ q))
print('retrieved:', docs[top])
print('\\nReal pipeline: chunk 300-800 tokens with overlap -> embed -> ANN index -> rerank -> prompt.')
```

**Remember:** Always show the source of each retrieved chunk in the answer so users can verify it.

**Common mistake:** Chunking blindly at 1000 characters and cutting tables and code blocks in half.

## 10. Choosing chunk size empirically

RAG grounds answers in your documents: chunk, embed, store, retrieve the top-k for the question, and put them in the prompt. Retrieval quality is the whole ballgame — a perfect model answering from the wrong three chunks is still wrong.

```python
import numpy as np

docs = [
    'Refunds are processed within 5 business days.',
    'Our office is in Pune, open 9am to 6pm.',
    'Enterprise plans include a dedicated support engineer.',
]

def fake_embed(text):                       # stand-in for a real embedding model
    rng = np.random.default_rng(abs(hash(text)) % (2 ** 32))
    v = rng.normal(size=32)
    return v / np.linalg.norm(v)

index = np.array([fake_embed(d) for d in docs])
q = fake_embed('how long do refunds take')
top = int(np.argmax(index @ q))
print('retrieved:', docs[top])
print('\\nReal pipeline: chunk 300-800 tokens with overlap -> embed -> ANN index -> rerank -> prompt.')
```

**Remember:** Always show the source of each retrieved chunk in the answer so users can verify it.

**Common mistake:** Chunking blindly at 1000 characters and cutting tables and code blocks in half.
