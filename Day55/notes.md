## 1. Maximum margin classification

A vector is a list of numbers with a direction and length. The dot product measures alignment: large and positive when two vectors point the same way, zero when perpendicular. Cosine similarity is the dot product with length divided out, which is why it compares embeddings of different magnitudes fairly.

```python
import numpy as np

a = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
b = np.array([2.0, 4.0, 6.0])

print('dot   ', a @ b)
print('norm  ', np.linalg.norm(a))
cos = (a @ b) / (np.linalg.norm(a) * np.linalg.norm(b))
print('cosine', cos)   # 1.0 -> same direction
```

**Remember:** Cosine similarity ignores magnitude; Euclidean distance does not. Pick the one that matches your question.

**Common mistake:** Comparing raw embeddings with Euclidean distance when only direction carries meaning.

Practice: open `examples/01_maximum_margin_classification.py`, predict the output, change one line, predict again.

## 2. Support vectors

A vector is a list of numbers with a direction and length. The dot product measures alignment: large and positive when two vectors point the same way, zero when perpendicular. Cosine similarity is the dot product with length divided out, which is why it compares embeddings of different magnitudes fairly.

import numpy as np

a = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
b = np.array([2.0, 4.0, 6.0])

print('dot   ', a @ b)
print('norm  ', np.linalg.norm(a))
cos = (a @ b) / (np.linalg.norm(a) * np.linalg.norm(b))
print('cosine', cos)   # 1.0 -> same direction
```

**Remember:** Cosine similarity ignores magnitude; Euclidean distance does not. Pick the one that matches your question.

**Common mistake:** Comparing raw embeddings with Euclidean distance when only direction carries meaning.

Practice: open `examples/02_support_vectors.py`, predict the output, change one line, predict again.

## 3. The C parameter and soft margins

A vector is a list of numbers with a direction and length. The dot product measures alignment: large and positive when two vectors point the same way, zero when perpendicular. Cosine similarity is the dot product with length divided out, which is why it compares embeddings of different magnitudes fairly.

```python
import numpy as np

a = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
b = np.array([2.0, 4.0, 6.0])

print('dot   ', a @ b)
print('norm  ', np.linalg.norm(a))
cos = (a @ b) / (np.linalg.norm(a) * np.linalg.norm(b))
print('cosine', cos)   # 1.0 -> same direction
```

**Remember:** Cosine similarity ignores magnitude; Euclidean distance does not. Pick the one that matches your question.

**Common mistake:** Comparing raw embeddings with Euclidean distance when only direction carries meaning.

Practice: open `examples/03_the_c_parameter_and_soft_margins.py`, predict the output, change one line, predict again.

## 4. Hinge loss

A vector is a list of numbers with a direction and length. The dot product measures alignment: large and positive when two vectors point the same way, zero when perpendicular. Cosine similarity is the dot product with length divided out, which is why it compares embeddings of different magnitudes fairly.

```python
import numpy as np

a = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
b = np.array([2.0, 4.0, 6.0])

print('dot   ', a @ b)
print('norm  ', np.linalg.norm(a))
cos = (a @ b) / (np.linalg.norm(a) * np.linalg.norm(b))
print('cosine', cos)   # 1.0 -> same direction
```

**Remember:** Cosine similarity ignores magnitude; Euclidean distance does not. Pick the one that matches your question.

**Common mistake:** Comparing raw embeddings with Euclidean distance when only direction carries meaning.

Practice: open `examples/04_hinge_loss.py`, predict the output, change one line, predict again.

## 5. The kernel trick

Notebooks keep state between cells, which is great for exploring and terrible for reproducibility. Treat the notebook as a scratchpad; once logic settles, move it into a `.py` module you can import and test.

```python
# In a notebook, cell order != execution order.
# Restart & Run All before you trust any result.
import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame({'x': [1, 2, 3]})
df.head()
```

**Remember:** 'Restart kernel and run all' is the only honest test that a notebook works.

**Common mistake:** Shipping a notebook whose results depend on a deleted cell you ran ten minutes ago.

Practice: open `examples/05_the_kernel_trick.py`, predict the output, change one line, predict again.

## 6. RBF, polynomial and linear kernels

Notebooks keep state between cells, which is great for exploring and terrible for reproducibility. Treat the notebook as a scratchpad; once logic settles, move it into a `.py` module you can import and test.

```python
# In a notebook, cell order != execution order.
# Restart & Run All before you trust any result.
import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame({'x': [1, 2, 3]})
df.head()
```

**Remember:** 'Restart kernel and run all' is the only honest test that a notebook works.

**Common mistake:** Shipping a notebook whose results depend on a deleted cell you ran ten minutes ago.

Practice: open `examples/06_rbf_polynomial_and_linear_kernels.py`, predict the output, change one line, predict again.

## 7. Gamma and the bias-variance effect

A vector is a list of numbers with a direction and length. The dot product measures alignment: large and positive when two vectors point the same way, zero when perpendicular. Cosine similarity is the dot product with length divided out, which is why it compares embeddings of different magnitudes fairly.

```python
import numpy as np

a = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
b = np.array([2.0, 4.0, 6.0])

print('dot   ', a @ b)
print('norm  ', np.linalg.norm(a))
cos = (a @ b) / (np.linalg.norm(a) * np.linalg.norm(b))
print('cosine', cos)   # 1.0 -> same direction
```

**Remember:** Cosine similarity ignores magnitude; Euclidean distance does not. Pick the one that matches your question.

**Common mistake:** Comparing raw embeddings with Euclidean distance when only direction carries meaning.

Practice: open `examples/07_gamma_and_the_bias_variance_effect.py`, predict the output, change one line, predict again.

## 8. SVM for regression (SVR)

A vector is a list of numbers with a direction and length. The dot product measures alignment: large and positive when two vectors point the same way, zero when perpendicular. Cosine similarity is the dot product with length divided out, which is why it compares embeddings of different magnitudes fairly.

```python
import numpy as np

a = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
b = np.array([2.0, 4.0, 6.0])

print('dot   ', a @ b)
print('norm  ', np.linalg.norm(a))
cos = (a @ b) / (np.linalg.norm(a) * np.linalg.norm(b))
print('cosine', cos)   # 1.0 -> same direction
```

**Remember:** Cosine similarity ignores magnitude; Euclidean distance does not. Pick the one that matches your question.

**Common mistake:** Comparing raw embeddings with Euclidean distance when only direction carries meaning.

Practice: open `examples/08_svm_for_regression_svr.py`, predict the output, change one line, predict again.

## 9. Scaling requirements and cost at scale

A vector is a list of numbers with a direction and length. The dot product measures alignment: large and positive when two vectors point the same way, zero when perpendicular. Cosine similarity is the dot product with length divided out, which is why it compares embeddings of different magnitudes fairly.

```python
import numpy as np

a = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
b = np.array([2.0, 4.0, 6.0])

print('dot   ', a @ b)
print('norm  ', np.linalg.norm(a))
cos = (a @ b) / (np.linalg.norm(a) * np.linalg.norm(b))
print('cosine', cos)   # 1.0 -> same direction
```

**Remember:** Cosine similarity ignores magnitude; Euclidean distance does not. Pick the one that matches your question.

**Common mistake:** Comparing raw embeddings with Euclidean distance when only direction carries meaning.

Practice: open `examples/09_scaling_requirements_and_cost_at_scale.py`, predict the output, change one line, predict again.

a = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
b = np.array([2.0, 4.0, 6.0])

print('dot   ', a @ b)
print('norm  ', np.linalg.norm(a))
cos = (a @ b) / (np.linalg.norm(a) * np.linalg.norm(b))
print('cosine', cos)   # 1.0 -> same direction
```

**Remember:** Cosine similarity ignores magnitude; Euclidean distance does not. Pick the one that matches your question.

**Common mistake:** Comparing raw embeddings with Euclidean distance when only direction carries meaning.

- Explain **The kernel trick** to someone else without notes.
- Run every file in `examples/` and predict its output before running it.
- Answer `questions.md` before opening `answers.md`.

Now open `examples/`, run each file, then break it on purpose and fix it.
