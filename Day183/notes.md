## 1. What a model incident looks like

ML code needs the same tests as any code, plus data tests: schema, ranges, null rates, class balance. Add one behavioural test per known failure mode — a test that would have caught last quarter's outage is worth more than 90% coverage.

```python
import numpy as np

def preprocess(x):
    x = np.asarray(x, dtype=float)
    if np.isnan(x).any():
        raise ValueError('NaN in input')
    return (x - x.mean()) / (x.std() + 1e-8)

def test_preprocess():
    out = preprocess([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
    assert abs(float(out.mean())) < 1e-6, 'should be zero-centred'
    assert abs(float(out.std()) - 1.0) < 1e-6, 'should be unit variance'
    try:
        preprocess([1.0, float('nan')])
    except ValueError:
        pass
    else:
        raise AssertionError('NaN should have raised')
    print('ok')

test_preprocess()
```

**Remember:** Test the data contract, not just the function — bad data breaks more models than bad code.

**Common mistake:** Testing only the happy path, so an all-null column silently trains a constant model.

## 2. Detection and paging

ML code needs the same tests as any code, plus data tests: schema, ranges, null rates, class balance. Add one behavioural test per known failure mode — a test that would have caught last quarter's outage is worth more than 90% coverage.

```python
import numpy as np

def preprocess(x):
    x = np.asarray(x, dtype=float)
    if np.isnan(x).any():
        raise ValueError('NaN in input')
    return (x - x.mean()) / (x.std() + 1e-8)

def test_preprocess():
    out = preprocess([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
    assert abs(float(out.mean())) < 1e-6, 'should be zero-centred'
    assert abs(float(out.std()) - 1.0) < 1e-6, 'should be unit variance'
    try:
        preprocess([1.0, float('nan')])
    except ValueError:
        pass
    else:
        raise AssertionError('NaN should have raised')
    print('ok')

test_preprocess()
```

**Remember:** Test the data contract, not just the function — bad data breaks more models than bad code.

**Common mistake:** Testing only the happy path, so an all-null column silently trains a constant model.

## 3. Immediate mitigation: rollback or disable

ML code needs the same tests as any code, plus data tests: schema, ranges, null rates, class balance. Add one behavioural test per known failure mode — a test that would have caught last quarter's outage is worth more than 90% coverage.

```python
import numpy as np

def preprocess(x):
    x = np.asarray(x, dtype=float)
    if np.isnan(x).any():
        raise ValueError('NaN in input')
    return (x - x.mean()) / (x.std() + 1e-8)

def test_preprocess():
    out = preprocess([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
    assert abs(float(out.mean())) < 1e-6, 'should be zero-centred'
    assert abs(float(out.std()) - 1.0) < 1e-6, 'should be unit variance'
    try:
        preprocess([1.0, float('nan')])
    except ValueError:
        pass
    else:
        raise AssertionError('NaN should have raised')
    print('ok')

test_preprocess()
```

**Common mistake:** Testing only the happy path, so an all-null column silently trains a constant model.

## 4. Root cause categories

ML code needs the same tests as any code, plus data tests: schema, ranges, null rates, class balance. Add one behavioural test per known failure mode — a test that would have caught last quarter's outage is worth more than 90% coverage.

```python
import numpy as np

def preprocess(x):
    x = np.asarray(x, dtype=float)
    if np.isnan(x).any():
        raise ValueError('NaN in input')
    return (x - x.mean()) / (x.std() + 1e-8)

def test_preprocess():
    out = preprocess([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
    assert abs(float(out.mean())) < 1e-6, 'should be zero-centred'
    assert abs(float(out.std()) - 1.0) < 1e-6, 'should be unit variance'
    try:
        preprocess([1.0, float('nan')])
    except ValueError:
        pass
    else:
        raise AssertionError('NaN should have raised')
    print('ok')

test_preprocess()
```

**Remember:** Test the data contract, not just the function — bad data breaks more models than bad code.

**Common mistake:** Testing only the happy path, so an all-null column silently trains a constant model.

## 5. Data pipeline failures

A Pipeline chains preprocessing and the model into one object that fits and predicts as a unit. This is the single best defence against leakage, and it means deployment ships one artefact instead of six loose steps you must remember to repeat.

```python
import numpy as np, pandas as pd
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

df = pd.DataFrame({'age': [25, np.nan, 40, 33], 'city': ['pune', 'delhi', 'pune', 'delhi']})
y = [0, 1, 0, 1]

pre = ColumnTransformer([
    ('num', Pipeline([('imp', SimpleImputer(strategy='median')), ('sc', StandardScaler())]), ['age']),
    ('cat', OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore'), ['city']),
])
model = Pipeline([('pre', pre), ('clf', LogisticRegression())]).fit(df, y)
print(model.predict(df))
```

**Remember:** `handle_unknown='ignore'` stops production crashing on a category you never saw in training.

**Common mistake:** Preprocessing in a notebook and then forgetting one step when writing the serving code.

## 6. Silent quality degradation

ML code needs the same tests as any code, plus data tests: schema, ranges, null rates, class balance. Add one behavioural test per known failure mode — a test that would have caught last quarter's outage is worth more than 90% coverage.

```python
import numpy as np

def preprocess(x):
    x = np.asarray(x, dtype=float)
    if np.isnan(x).any():
        raise ValueError('NaN in input')
    return (x - x.mean()) / (x.std() + 1e-8)

def test_preprocess():
    out = preprocess([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
    assert abs(float(out.mean())) < 1e-6, 'should be zero-centred'
    assert abs(float(out.std()) - 1.0) < 1e-6, 'should be unit variance'
    try:
        preprocess([1.0, float('nan')])
    except ValueError:
        pass
    else:
        raise AssertionError('NaN should have raised')
    print('ok')

test_preprocess()
```

**Remember:** Test the data contract, not just the function — bad data breaks more models than bad code.

**Common mistake:** Testing only the happy path, so an all-null column silently trains a constant model.

## 7. Communication with stakeholders

ML code needs the same tests as any code, plus data tests: schema, ranges, null rates, class balance. Add one behavioural test per known failure mode — a test that would have caught last quarter's outage is worth more than 90% coverage.

```python
import numpy as np

def preprocess(x):
    x = np.asarray(x, dtype=float)
    if np.isnan(x).any():
        raise ValueError('NaN in input')
    return (x - x.mean()) / (x.std() + 1e-8)

def test_preprocess():
    out = preprocess([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
    assert abs(float(out.mean())) < 1e-6, 'should be zero-centred'
    assert abs(float(out.std()) - 1.0) < 1e-6, 'should be unit variance'
    try:
        preprocess([1.0, float('nan')])
    except ValueError:
        pass
    else:
        raise AssertionError('NaN should have raised')
    print('ok')

test_preprocess()
```

**Remember:** Test the data contract, not just the function — bad data breaks more models than bad code.

**Common mistake:** Testing only the happy path, so an all-null column silently trains a constant model.

## 8. Postmortems without blame

ML code needs the same tests as any code, plus data tests: schema, ranges, null rates, class balance. Add one behavioural test per known failure mode — a test that would have caught last quarter's outage is worth more than 90% coverage.

```python
import numpy as np

def preprocess(x):
    x = np.asarray(x, dtype=float)
    if np.isnan(x).any():
        raise ValueError('NaN in input')
    return (x - x.mean()) / (x.std() + 1e-8)

def test_preprocess():
    out = preprocess([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
    assert abs(float(out.mean())) < 1e-6, 'should be zero-centred'
    assert abs(float(out.std()) - 1.0) < 1e-6, 'should be unit variance'
    try:
        preprocess([1.0, float('nan')])
    except ValueError:
        pass
    else:
        raise AssertionError('NaN should have raised')
    print('ok')

test_preprocess()
```

**Remember:** Test the data contract, not just the function — bad data breaks more models than bad code.

**Common mistake:** Testing only the happy path, so an all-null column silently trains a constant model.

## 9. Turning incidents into tests

ML code needs the same tests as any code, plus data tests: schema, ranges, null rates, class balance. Add one behavioural test per known failure mode — a test that would have caught last quarter's outage is worth more than 90% coverage.

```python
import numpy as np

def preprocess(x):
    x = np.asarray(x, dtype=float)
    if np.isnan(x).any():
        raise ValueError('NaN in input')
    return (x - x.mean()) / (x.std() + 1e-8)

def test_preprocess():
    out = preprocess([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
    assert abs(float(out.mean())) < 1e-6, 'should be zero-centred'
    assert abs(float(out.std()) - 1.0) < 1e-6, 'should be unit variance'
    try:
        preprocess([1.0, float('nan')])
    except ValueError:
        pass
    else:
        raise AssertionError('NaN should have raised')
    print('ok')

test_preprocess()
```

**Remember:** Test the data contract, not just the function — bad data breaks more models than bad code.

**Common mistake:** Testing only the happy path, so an all-null column silently trains a constant model.

## 10. Reducing mean time to recovery

The mean is pulled around by outliers; the median is not. Report both, plus a spread measure. When mean and median disagree sharply, the distribution is skewed and averages are lying to you.

```python
import numpy as np

salaries = np.array([30, 32, 35, 33, 31, 900])   # one founder
print('mean  ', salaries.mean())     # 176.8 — misleading
print('median', np.median(salaries)) # 32.5  — honest
print('p95   ', np.percentile(salaries, 95))

q1, q3 = np.percentile(salaries, [25, 75])
iqr = q3 - q1
print('outliers', salaries[(salaries < q1 - 1.5 * iqr) | (salaries > q3 + 1.5 * iqr)])
```

**Remember:** Quote median + IQR for skewed data, mean + std only for roughly symmetric data.

**Common mistake:** Removing 'outliers' automatically when they are the exact events you were hired to predict.
