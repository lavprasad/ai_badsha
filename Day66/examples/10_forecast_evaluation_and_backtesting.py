# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Remember: Always check `df.shape` before and after a merge — a silent row explosion means duplicate keys.
# Common mistake: Chained assignment (`df[df.a > 1]['b'] = 0`) that writes to a copy and changes nothing.
#
# Try it: change one number or one line above, predict the new output,
# then run it again. Being wrong here is cheap; being wrong in production
# is not.
