## 1. What makes time series different

A DataFrame is a table with labelled columns and an index. Most real ML work is 80% reshaping tables: load, clean, group, join, aggregate. Learn `groupby` and `merge` well and you can answer most data questions without writing loops.

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({
    'city': ['pune', 'pune', 'delhi', 'delhi'],
    'sales': [10, 20, 5, 7],
})
print(df.groupby('city')['sales'].sum())

lookup = pd.DataFrame({'city': ['pune', 'delhi'], 'zone': ['west', 'north']})
print(df.merge(lookup, on='city', how='left'))
```

**Remember:** Always check `df.shape` before and after a merge — a silent row explosion means duplicate keys.

**Common mistake:** Chained assignment (`df[df.a > 1]['b'] = 0`) that writes to a copy and changes nothing.

Practice: open `examples/01_what_makes_time_series_different.py`, predict the output, change one line, predict again.

## 2. Trend, seasonality, residual decomposition

A DataFrame is a table with labelled columns and an index. Most real ML work is 80% reshaping tables: load, clean, group, join, aggregate. Learn `groupby` and `merge` well and you can answer most data questions without writing loops.

})
print(df.groupby('city')['sales'].sum())

lookup = pd.DataFrame({'city': ['pune', 'delhi'], 'zone': ['west', 'north']})
print(df.merge(lookup, on='city', how='left'))
```

**Remember:** Always check `df.shape` before and after a merge — a silent row explosion means duplicate keys.

**Common mistake:** Chained assignment (`df[df.a > 1]['b'] = 0`) that writes to a copy and changes nothing.

## What you should be able to do after Day 66

- Explain **What makes time series different** to someone else without notes.
- Explain **Trend, seasonality, residual decomposition** to someone else without notes.
- Explain **Stationarity and differencing** to someone else without notes.
- Explain **Autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation** to someone else without notes.
- Explain **ARIMA family** to someone else without notes.
- Run every file in `examples/` and predict its output before running it.
- Answer `questions.md` before opening `answers.md`.

Now open `examples/`, run each file, then break it on purpose and fix it.
