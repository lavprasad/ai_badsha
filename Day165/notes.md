## 1. What to log for every call

Models rot. The world moves, inputs shift (data drift) or the relationship itself changes (concept drift). Monitor input distributions and prediction distributions daily, because ground-truth labels usually arrive weeks late.

```python
import numpy as np

def psi(expected, actual, bins=10):
    """Population Stability Index: >0.2 means investigate."""
    edges = np.percentile(expected, np.linspace(0, 100, bins + 1))
    edges[0], edges[-1] = -np.inf, np.inf
    e = np.histogram(expected, edges)[0] / len(expected) + 1e-6
    a = np.histogram(actual, edges)[0] / len(actual) + 1e-6
    return float(np.sum((a - e) * np.log(a / e)))

rng = np.random.default_rng(0)
baseline = rng.normal(0, 1, 10_000)
print('same dist  PSI', round(psi(baseline, rng.normal(0, 1, 5_000)), 4))
print('shifted    PSI', round(psi(baseline, rng.normal(0.6, 1.2, 5_000)), 4))
```

**Remember:** PSI under 0.1 stable, 0.1-0.2 watch, above 0.2 investigate. Alert on the prediction distribution too.

**Common mistake:** Only monitoring uptime, so a model that returns 200 OK while being badly wrong looks healthy.

## 2. Prompt and response capture with privacy

Models learn the bias in their training data and then apply it at scale with a veneer of objectivity. Measure error rates per group, not just overall. Fairness definitions genuinely conflict with each other — you must choose one explicitly and document why.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({
    'group': ['a'] * 100 + ['b'] * 100,
    'y':     [1] * 50 + [0] * 50 + [1] * 50 + [0] * 50,
    'pred':  [1] * 45 + [0] * 55 + [1] * 30 + [0] * 70,
})
for g, sub in df.groupby('group'):
    tpr = ((sub.pred == 1) & (sub.y == 1)).sum() / max((sub.y == 1).sum(), 1)
    rate = (sub.pred == 1).mean()
    print(f'group {g}: selection rate {rate:.2f}  recall {tpr:.2f}')
print('Large gaps here are the finding — investigate before shipping.')
```

**Remember:** Dropping the sensitive attribute does not remove bias; proxies (pincode, name) carry it right back in.

**Common mistake:** Auditing fairness once at launch and never again as the data drifts.

## 3. Token and cost accounting

Models rot. The world moves, inputs shift (data drift) or the relationship itself changes (concept drift). Monitor input distributions and prediction distributions daily, because ground-truth labels usually arrive weeks late.

```python
import numpy as np

def psi(expected, actual, bins=10):
    """Population Stability Index: >0.2 means investigate."""
    edges = np.percentile(expected, np.linspace(0, 100, bins + 1))
    edges[0], edges[-1] = -np.inf, np.inf
    e = np.histogram(expected, edges)[0] / len(expected) + 1e-6
    a = np.histogram(actual, edges)[0] / len(actual) + 1e-6
    return float(np.sum((a - e) * np.log(a / e)))

rng = np.random.default_rng(0)
baseline = rng.normal(0, 1, 10_000)
print('same dist  PSI', round(psi(baseline, rng.normal(0, 1, 5_000)), 4))
print('shifted    PSI', round(psi(baseline, rng.normal(0.6, 1.2, 5_000)), 4))
```

**Remember:** PSI under 0.1 stable, 0.1-0.2 watch, above 0.2 investigate. Alert on the prediction distribution too.

**Common mistake:** Only monitoring uptime, so a model that returns 200 OK while being badly wrong looks healthy.

## 4. Latency percentiles

Models rot. The world moves, inputs shift (data drift) or the relationship itself changes (concept drift). Monitor input distributions and prediction distributions daily, because ground-truth labels usually arrive weeks late.

```python
import numpy as np

def psi(expected, actual, bins=10):
    """Population Stability Index: >0.2 means investigate."""
    edges = np.percentile(expected, np.linspace(0, 100, bins + 1))
    edges[0], edges[-1] = -np.inf, np.inf
    e = np.histogram(expected, edges)[0] / len(expected) + 1e-6
    a = np.histogram(actual, edges)[0] / len(actual) + 1e-6
    return float(np.sum((a - e) * np.log(a / e)))

rng = np.random.default_rng(0)
baseline = rng.normal(0, 1, 10_000)
print('same dist  PSI', round(psi(baseline, rng.normal(0, 1, 5_000)), 4))
print('shifted    PSI', round(psi(baseline, rng.normal(0.6, 1.2, 5_000)), 4))
```

**Remember:** PSI under 0.1 stable, 0.1-0.2 watch, above 0.2 investigate. Alert on the prediction distribution too.

**Common mistake:** Only monitoring uptime, so a model that returns 200 OK while being badly wrong looks healthy.

## 5. Tracing multi-step chains

Models rot. The world moves, inputs shift (data drift) or the relationship itself changes (concept drift). Monitor input distributions and prediction distributions daily, because ground-truth labels usually arrive weeks late.

```python
import numpy as np

def psi(expected, actual, bins=10):
    """Population Stability Index: >0.2 means investigate."""
    edges = np.percentile(expected, np.linspace(0, 100, bins + 1))
    edges[0], edges[-1] = -np.inf, np.inf
    e = np.histogram(expected, edges)[0] / len(expected) + 1e-6
    a = np.histogram(actual, edges)[0] / len(actual) + 1e-6
    return float(np.sum((a - e) * np.log(a / e)))

rng = np.random.default_rng(0)
baseline = rng.normal(0, 1, 10_000)
print('same dist  PSI', round(psi(baseline, rng.normal(0, 1, 5_000)), 4))
print('shifted    PSI', round(psi(baseline, rng.normal(0.6, 1.2, 5_000)), 4))
```

**Remember:** PSI under 0.1 stable, 0.1-0.2 watch, above 0.2 investigate. Alert on the prediction distribution too.

**Common mistake:** Only monitoring uptime, so a model that returns 200 OK while being badly wrong looks healthy.

## 6. Error taxonomies

Models rot. The world moves, inputs shift (data drift) or the relationship itself changes (concept drift). Monitor input distributions and prediction distributions daily, because ground-truth labels usually arrive weeks late.

```python
import numpy as np

def psi(expected, actual, bins=10):
    """Population Stability Index: >0.2 means investigate."""
    edges = np.percentile(expected, np.linspace(0, 100, bins + 1))
    edges[0], edges[-1] = -np.inf, np.inf
    e = np.histogram(expected, edges)[0] / len(expected) + 1e-6
    a = np.histogram(actual, edges)[0] / len(actual) + 1e-6
    return float(np.sum((a - e) * np.log(a / e)))

rng = np.random.default_rng(0)
baseline = rng.normal(0, 1, 10_000)
print('same dist  PSI', round(psi(baseline, rng.normal(0, 1, 5_000)), 4))
print('shifted    PSI', round(psi(baseline, rng.normal(0.6, 1.2, 5_000)), 4))
```

**Remember:** PSI under 0.1 stable, 0.1-0.2 watch, above 0.2 investigate. Alert on the prediction distribution too.

**Common mistake:** Only monitoring uptime, so a model that returns 200 OK while being badly wrong looks healthy.

## 7. Sampling and retention policies

A distribution says which values are likely. Gaussian for measurement noise, Bernoulli for yes/no, Poisson for counts per interval. Choosing the right one is choosing your loss function: Gaussian likelihood gives MSE, Bernoulli gives cross-entropy.

```python
import numpy as np

rng = np.random.default_rng(0)
normal = rng.normal(loc=0, scale=1, size=10_000)
coin = rng.binomial(n=1, p=0.3, size=10_000)

print('normal mean/std', round(normal.mean(), 3), round(normal.std(), 3))
print('coin heads rate ', coin.mean())
```

**Remember:** Always seed your RNG (`default_rng(0)`) when you want a result someone else can reproduce.

**Common mistake:** Assuming Gaussian for skewed, bounded, or count data and then being surprised by the residuals.

## 8. Dashboards that surface regressions

Models rot. The world moves, inputs shift (data drift) or the relationship itself changes (concept drift). Monitor input distributions and prediction distributions daily, because ground-truth labels usually arrive weeks late.

```python
import numpy as np

def psi(expected, actual, bins=10):
    """Population Stability Index: >0.2 means investigate."""
    edges = np.percentile(expected, np.linspace(0, 100, bins + 1))
    edges[0], edges[-1] = -np.inf, np.inf
    e = np.histogram(expected, edges)[0] / len(expected) + 1e-6
    a = np.histogram(actual, edges)[0] / len(actual) + 1e-6
    return float(np.sum((a - e) * np.log(a / e)))

rng = np.random.default_rng(0)
baseline = rng.normal(0, 1, 10_000)
print('same dist  PSI', round(psi(baseline, rng.normal(0, 1, 5_000)), 4))
print('shifted    PSI', round(psi(baseline, rng.normal(0.6, 1.2, 5_000)), 4))
```

**Remember:** PSI under 0.1 stable, 0.1-0.2 watch, above 0.2 investigate. Alert on the prediction distribution too.

**Common mistake:** Only monitoring uptime, so a model that returns 200 OK while being badly wrong looks healthy.

## 9. Alerting on quality, not just uptime

Models rot. The world moves, inputs shift (data drift) or the relationship itself changes (concept drift). Monitor input distributions and prediction distributions daily, because ground-truth labels usually arrive weeks late.

```python
import numpy as np

def psi(expected, actual, bins=10):
    """Population Stability Index: >0.2 means investigate."""
    edges = np.percentile(expected, np.linspace(0, 100, bins + 1))
    edges[0], edges[-1] = -np.inf, np.inf
    e = np.histogram(expected, edges)[0] / len(expected) + 1e-6
    a = np.histogram(actual, edges)[0] / len(actual) + 1e-6
    return float(np.sum((a - e) * np.log(a / e)))

rng = np.random.default_rng(0)
baseline = rng.normal(0, 1, 10_000)
print('same dist  PSI', round(psi(baseline, rng.normal(0, 1, 5_000)), 4))
print('shifted    PSI', round(psi(baseline, rng.normal(0.6, 1.2, 5_000)), 4))
```

**Remember:** PSI under 0.1 stable, 0.1-0.2 watch, above 0.2 investigate. Alert on the prediction distribution too.

**Common mistake:** Only monitoring uptime, so a model that returns 200 OK while being badly wrong looks healthy.

## 10. Building a minimal trace viewer

Models rot. The world moves, inputs shift (data drift) or the relationship itself changes (concept drift). Monitor input distributions and prediction distributions daily, because ground-truth labels usually arrive weeks late.

```python
import numpy as np

def psi(expected, actual, bins=10):
    """Population Stability Index: >0.2 means investigate."""
    edges = np.percentile(expected, np.linspace(0, 100, bins + 1))
    edges[0], edges[-1] = -np.inf, np.inf
    e = np.histogram(expected, edges)[0] / len(expected) + 1e-6
    a = np.histogram(actual, edges)[0] / len(actual) + 1e-6
    return float(np.sum((a - e) * np.log(a / e)))

rng = np.random.default_rng(0)
baseline = rng.normal(0, 1, 10_000)
print('same dist  PSI', round(psi(baseline, rng.normal(0, 1, 5_000)), 4))
print('shifted    PSI', round(psi(baseline, rng.normal(0.6, 1.2, 5_000)), 4))
```

**Remember:** PSI under 0.1 stable, 0.1-0.2 watch, above 0.2 investigate. Alert on the prediction distribution too.

**Common mistake:** Only monitoring uptime, so a model that returns 200 OK while being badly wrong looks healthy.
