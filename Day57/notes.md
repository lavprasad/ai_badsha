## 1. Parameters vs hyperparameters

Hyperparameters are the settings you choose, not learn. Grid search is exhaustive and wasteful; random search finds good regions faster in high dimensions; Bayesian search learns from previous trials. Always search inside cross-validation.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
import numpy as np

X, y = load_breast_cancer(return_X_y=True)
space = {
    'n_estimators': [100, 300, 600],
    'max_depth': [None, 4, 8, 16],
    'min_samples_leaf': [1, 2, 4, 8],
}
search = RandomizedSearchCV(
    RandomForestClassifier(random_state=0, n_jobs=-1),
    space, n_iter=12, cv=5, random_state=0,
).fit(X, y)
print(search.best_params_, round(search.best_score_, 4))
```

**Remember:** Fix the random seed and log every trial, or you cannot reproduce your own best model.

**Common mistake:** Tuning 40 hyperparameters on 400 rows — you are now fitting the validation set.

Practice: open `examples/01_parameters_vs_hyperparameters.py`, predict the output, change one line, predict again.

## 2. Manual tuning and its limits

Hyperparameters are the settings you choose, not learn. Grid search is exhaustive and wasteful; random search finds good regions faster in high dimensions; Bayesian search learns from previous trials. Always search inside cross-validation.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
import numpy as np

X, y = load_breast_cancer(return_X_y=True)
space = {
    'n_estimators': [100, 300, 600],
    'max_depth': [None, 4, 8, 16],
    'min_samples_leaf': [1, 2, 4, 8],
}
search = RandomizedSearchCV(
    RandomForestClassifier(random_state=0, n_jobs=-1),
    space, n_iter=12, cv=5, random_state=0,
).fit(X, y)
print(search.best_params_, round(search.best_score_, 4))
```

**Remember:** Fix the random seed and log every trial, or you cannot reproduce your own best model.

**Common mistake:** Tuning 40 hyperparameters on 400 rows — you are now fitting the validation set.

Practice: open `examples/02_manual_tuning_and_its_limits.py`, predict the output, change one line, predict again.

## 3. Grid search

Hyperparameters are the settings you choose, not learn. Grid search is exhaustive and wasteful; random search finds good regions faster in high dimensions; Bayesian search learns from previous trials. Always search inside cross-validation.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
import numpy as np

X, y = load_breast_cancer(return_X_y=True)
space = {
    'n_estimators': [100, 300, 600],
    'max_depth': [None, 4, 8, 16],
    'min_samples_leaf': [1, 2, 4, 8],
}
search = RandomizedSearchCV(
    RandomForestClassifier(random_state=0, n_jobs=-1),
    space, n_iter=12, cv=5, random_state=0,
).fit(X, y)
print(search.best_params_, round(search.best_score_, 4))
```

**Remember:** Fix the random seed and log every trial, or you cannot reproduce your own best model.

**Common mistake:** Tuning 40 hyperparameters on 400 rows — you are now fitting the validation set.

Practice: open `examples/03_grid_search.py`, predict the output, change one line, predict again.

## 4. Random search and why it wins

Hyperparameters are the settings you choose, not learn. Grid search is exhaustive and wasteful; random search finds good regions faster in high dimensions; Bayesian search learns from previous trials. Always search inside cross-validation.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
import numpy as np

X, y = load_breast_cancer(return_X_y=True)
space = {
    'n_estimators': [100, 300, 600],
    'max_depth': [None, 4, 8, 16],
    'min_samples_leaf': [1, 2, 4, 8],
}
search = RandomizedSearchCV(
    RandomForestClassifier(random_state=0, n_jobs=-1),
    space, n_iter=12, cv=5, random_state=0,
).fit(X, y)
print(search.best_params_, round(search.best_score_, 4))
```

**Remember:** Fix the random seed and log every trial, or you cannot reproduce your own best model.

**Common mistake:** Tuning 40 hyperparameters on 400 rows — you are now fitting the validation set.

Practice: open `examples/04_random_search_and_why_it_wins.py`, predict the output, change one line, predict again.

## 5. Bayesian optimisation

Bayes' rule updates a belief with evidence: posterior = likelihood x prior / evidence. The most common mistake in applied ML is ignoring the prior — a 99%-accurate test for a 1-in-10000 disease still gives mostly false positives.

```python
prior = 1 / 10_000          # base rate of the disease
sensitivity = 0.99          # P(positive | sick)
false_positive = 0.01       # P(positive | healthy)

evidence = sensitivity * prior + false_positive * (1 - prior)
posterior = sensitivity * prior / evidence
print(f'P(sick | positive) = {posterior:.4f}')   # ~0.0098
```

**Remember:** Rare events make precision collapse no matter how good the classifier looks on accuracy.

**Common mistake:** Reporting accuracy on an imbalanced problem where predicting 'no' always scores 99%.

Practice: open `examples/05_bayesian_optimisation.py`, predict the output, change one line, predict again.

## 6. Optuna and pruning bad trials

A tree asks yes/no questions, splitting to make each side purer. It needs no scaling, handles mixed types, and reads like a flowchart. Left unconstrained it memorises the training set perfectly, so depth and leaf-size limits are mandatory.

```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier, export_text
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

X, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True)
tree = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=3, min_samples_leaf=5, random_state=0).fit(X, y)
print(export_text(tree, feature_names=load_iris().feature_names))
```

**Remember:** A single unpruned tree is almost always worse than a small forest — but it is readable, which sometimes wins.

**Common mistake:** Trusting a deep tree's feature importances; they are unstable and biased toward high-cardinality columns.

Practice: open `examples/06_optuna_and_pruning_bad_trials.py`, predict the output, change one line, predict again.

## 7. Successive halving

Hyperparameters are the settings you choose, not learn. Grid search is exhaustive and wasteful; random search finds good regions faster in high dimensions; Bayesian search learns from previous trials. Always search inside cross-validation.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
import numpy as np

X, y = load_breast_cancer(return_X_y=True)
space = {
    'n_estimators': [100, 300, 600],
    'max_depth': [None, 4, 8, 16],
    'min_samples_leaf': [1, 2, 4, 8],
}
search = RandomizedSearchCV(
    RandomForestClassifier(random_state=0, n_jobs=-1),
    space, n_iter=12, cv=5, random_state=0,
).fit(X, y)
print(search.best_params_, round(search.best_score_, 4))
```

**Remember:** Fix the random seed and log every trial, or you cannot reproduce your own best model.

**Common mistake:** Tuning 40 hyperparameters on 400 rows — you are now fitting the validation set.

Practice: open `examples/07_successive_halving.py`, predict the output, change one line, predict again.

## 8. Search spaces that make sense

Hyperparameters are the settings you choose, not learn. Grid search is exhaustive and wasteful; random search finds good regions faster in high dimensions; Bayesian search learns from previous trials. Always search inside cross-validation.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
import numpy as np

X, y = load_breast_cancer(return_X_y=True)
space = {
    'n_estimators': [100, 300, 600],
    'max_depth': [None, 4, 8, 16],
    'min_samples_leaf': [1, 2, 4, 8],
}
search = RandomizedSearchCV(
    RandomForestClassifier(random_state=0, n_jobs=-1),
    space, n_iter=12, cv=5, random_state=0,
).fit(X, y)
print(search.best_params_, round(search.best_score_, 4))
```

**Remember:** Fix the random seed and log every trial, or you cannot reproduce your own best model.

**Common mistake:** Tuning 40 hyperparameters on 400 rows — you are now fitting the validation set.

Practice: open `examples/08_search_spaces_that_make_sense.py`, predict the output, change one line, predict again.

## 9. Budgeting compute for search

Hyperparameters are the settings you choose, not learn. Grid search is exhaustive and wasteful; random search finds good regions faster in high dimensions; Bayesian search learns from previous trials. Always search inside cross-validation.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
import numpy as np

X, y = load_breast_cancer(return_X_y=True)
space = {
    'n_estimators': [100, 300, 600],
    'max_depth': [None, 4, 8, 16],
    'min_samples_leaf': [1, 2, 4, 8],
}
search = RandomizedSearchCV(
    RandomForestClassifier(random_state=0, n_jobs=-1),
    space, n_iter=12, cv=5, random_state=0,
).fit(X, y)
print(search.best_params_, round(search.best_score_, 4))
```

**Remember:** Fix the random seed and log every trial, or you cannot reproduce your own best model.

**Common mistake:** Tuning 40 hyperparameters on 400 rows — you are now fitting the validation set.

Practice: open `examples/09_budgeting_compute_for_search.py`, predict the output, change one line, predict again.

## 10. Logging every trial

Hyperparameters are the settings you choose, not learn. Grid search is exhaustive and wasteful; random search finds good regions faster in high dimensions; Bayesian search learns from previous trials. Always search inside cross-validation.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
import numpy as np

X, y = load_breast_cancer(return_X_y=True)
space = {
    'n_estimators': [100, 300, 600],
    'max_depth': [None, 4, 8, 16],
    'min_samples_leaf': [1, 2, 4, 8],
}
search = RandomizedSearchCV(
    RandomForestClassifier(random_state=0, n_jobs=-1),
    space, n_iter=12, cv=5, random_state=0,
).fit(X, y)
print(search.best_params_, round(search.best_score_, 4))
```

**Remember:** Fix the random seed and log every trial, or you cannot reproduce your own best model.

**Common mistake:** Tuning 40 hyperparameters on 400 rows — you are now fitting the validation set.

Practice: open `examples/10_logging_every_trial.py`, predict the output, change one line, predict again.
