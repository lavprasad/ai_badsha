## 1. Goal: a fine-tuned classifier you can defend

Projects are where the learning sticks. Build a thin end-to-end slice first — load data, train something dumb, evaluate, serve one prediction — then improve one layer at a time. A working baseline on day one beats a perfect model that never ships.

```python
STEPS = [
    '1. Define the decision the model supports and the metric that measures it',
    '2. Get the data; write the loader; assert the schema',
    '3. Dumb baseline (mean / majority class) -> this is the bar',
    '4. Simple model + honest validation split',
    '5. Error analysis: look at 30 wrong predictions by hand',
    '6. Improve the biggest error bucket, not the leaderboard',
    '7. Serve it, log inputs and outputs, monitor drift',
]
for s in STEPS:
    print(s)
```

**Remember:** Spend an hour looking at wrong predictions before you spend a day tuning hyperparameters.

**Common mistake:** Six weeks of feature engineering with no baseline to prove any of it helped.

## 2. Dataset collection and cleaning

Projects are where the learning sticks. Build a thin end-to-end slice first — load data, train something dumb, evaluate, serve one prediction — then improve one layer at a time. A working baseline on day one beats a perfect model that never ships.

```python
STEPS = [
    '1. Define the decision the model supports and the metric that measures it',
    '2. Get the data; write the loader; assert the schema',
    '3. Dumb baseline (mean / majority class) -> this is the bar',
    '4. Simple model + honest validation split',
    '5. Error analysis: look at 30 wrong predictions by hand',
    '6. Improve the biggest error bucket, not the leaderboard',
    '7. Serve it, log inputs and outputs, monitor drift',
]
for s in STEPS:
    print(s)
```

**Remember:** Spend an hour looking at wrong predictions before you spend a day tuning hyperparameters.

**Common mistake:** Six weeks of feature engineering with no baseline to prove any of it helped.

## 3. Stratified splits and a locked test set

Projects are where the learning sticks. Build a thin end-to-end slice first — load data, train something dumb, evaluate, serve one prediction — then improve one layer at a time. A working baseline on day one beats a perfect model that never ships.

```python
STEPS = [
    '1. Define the decision the model supports and the metric that measures it',
    '2. Get the data; write the loader; assert the schema',
    '3. Dumb baseline (mean / majority class) -> this is the bar',
    '4. Simple model + honest validation split',
    '5. Error analysis: look at 30 wrong predictions by hand',
    '6. Improve the biggest error bucket, not the leaderboard',
    '7. Serve it, log inputs and outputs, monitor drift',
]
for s in STEPS:
    print(s)
```

**Remember:** Spend an hour looking at wrong predictions before you spend a day tuning hyperparameters.

**Common mistake:** Six weeks of feature engineering with no baseline to prove any of it helped.

## 4. Baseline: logistic regression on embeddings

Logistic regression squashes a linear score through a sigmoid to get a probability. The coefficients are log-odds: +0.7 means the odds roughly double per unit. It stays the default for anything where you must explain the decision to a regulator.

```python
import numpy as np

def sigmoid(z):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-np.clip(z, -500, 500)))

rng = np.random.default_rng(0)
X = rng.normal(size=(400, 2))
y = (X[:, 0] + X[:, 1] > 0).astype(float)

w, b, lr = np.zeros(2), 0.0, 0.5
for _ in range(500):
    p = sigmoid(X @ w + b)
    w -= lr * (X.T @ (p - y)) / len(y)
    b -= lr * float((p - y).mean())
print('weights', np.round(w, 2), 'acc', ((sigmoid(X @ w + b) > 0.5) == y).mean())
```

**Remember:** Clip the sigmoid input — `exp` of a large negative number overflows and returns NaN.

**Common mistake:** Reading the raw output as a calibrated probability without ever checking a calibration curve.

## 5. Transfer learning with a pretrained backbone

Almost nobody trains a vision model from scratch. Take a network pretrained on millions of images, replace the last layer, and either freeze the backbone (small data) or fine-tune it at a low learning rate (more data). This is the highest-leverage trick in applied vision.

```python
# Requires torch + torchvision
# import torchvision.models as models, torch.nn as nn
#
# model = models.resnet18(weights='IMAGENET1K_V1')
# for p in model.parameters():
#     p.requires_grad = False          # freeze the backbone
# model.fc = nn.Linear(model.fc.in_features, 3)   # 3 of your classes
# # only model.fc trains -> works with a few hundred images
print('Transfer learning: freeze backbone, replace head, train head, then unfreeze at low LR.')
```

**Remember:** Use the exact normalisation statistics the pretrained model was trained with.

**Common mistake:** Fine-tuning the whole network at 1e-3 and washing away everything ImageNet taught it.

## 6. Augmentation and regularisation tuning

Regularisation penalises large weights so the model prefers simpler explanations. L2 (ridge) shrinks everything smoothly; L1 (lasso) drives some weights exactly to zero and thereby selects features. Elastic net mixes both.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge, Lasso
from sklearn.datasets import make_regression

X, y = make_regression(n_samples=200, n_features=20, n_informative=5, noise=10, random_state=0)

ridge = Ridge(alpha=1.0).fit(X, y)
lasso = Lasso(alpha=1.0).fit(X, y)
print('ridge non-zero coefs', int(np.sum(np.abs(ridge.coef_) > 1e-6)))
print('lasso non-zero coefs', int(np.sum(np.abs(lasso.coef_) > 1e-6)))
```

**Remember:** Scale features before regularising, or the penalty punishes whichever column happens to use small units.

**Common mistake:** Tuning `alpha` on the test set — pick it with cross-validation on train only.

## 7. Training loop with checkpointing

PyTorch is NumPy with gradients and a GPU. The training loop is always the same five lines: zero grads, forward, loss, backward, step. Write it out by hand once — every framework wrapper is just hiding these five.

```python
# Requires: pip install torch  (does not run inside the browser sandbox)
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

model = nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(4, 16), nn.ReLU(), nn.Linear(16, 1))
opt = torch.optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=1e-3)
loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()

X = torch.randn(64, 4)
y = torch.randn(64, 1)
for step in range(50):
    opt.zero_grad()                # 1. clear old gradients
    pred = model(X)                # 2. forward
    loss = loss_fn(pred, y)        # 3. loss
    loss.backward()                # 4. backward
    opt.step()                     # 5. update
print('final loss', round(loss.item(), 4))
```

**Remember:** `opt.zero_grad()` first, every step. PyTorch accumulates gradients by design.

**Common mistake:** Calling `loss.backward()` twice without `retain_graph` and getting a confusing runtime error.

## 8. Error analysis on the worst classes

Projects are where the learning sticks. Build a thin end-to-end slice first — load data, train something dumb, evaluate, serve one prediction — then improve one layer at a time. A working baseline on day one beats a perfect model that never ships.

```python
STEPS = [
    '1. Define the decision the model supports and the metric that measures it',
    '2. Get the data; write the loader; assert the schema',
    '3. Dumb baseline (mean / majority class) -> this is the bar',
    '4. Simple model + honest validation split',
    '5. Error analysis: look at 30 wrong predictions by hand',
    '6. Improve the biggest error bucket, not the leaderboard',
    '7. Serve it, log inputs and outputs, monitor drift',
]
for s in STEPS:
    print(s)
```

**Remember:** Spend an hour looking at wrong predictions before you spend a day tuning hyperparameters.

**Common mistake:** Six weeks of feature engineering with no baseline to prove any of it helped.

## 9. Exporting for inference

Projects are where the learning sticks. Build a thin end-to-end slice first — load data, train something dumb, evaluate, serve one prediction — then improve one layer at a time. A working baseline on day one beats a perfect model that never ships.

```python
STEPS = [
    '1. Define the decision the model supports and the metric that measures it',
    '2. Get the data; write the loader; assert the schema',
    '3. Dumb baseline (mean / majority class) -> this is the bar',
    '4. Simple model + honest validation split',
    '5. Error analysis: look at 30 wrong predictions by hand',
    '6. Improve the biggest error bucket, not the leaderboard',
    '7. Serve it, log inputs and outputs, monitor drift',
]
for s in STEPS:
    print(s)
```

**Remember:** Spend an hour looking at wrong predictions before you spend a day tuning hyperparameters.

**Common mistake:** Six weeks of feature engineering with no baseline to prove any of it helped.

## 10. A short model card
