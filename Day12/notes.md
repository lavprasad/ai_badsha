## 1. seaborn on top of matplotlib

Plot before you model. A histogram exposes skew and outliers, a scatter exposes non-linearity, and a line of residuals exposes a model that is systematically wrong. Five minutes of plotting saves hours of confused tuning.

```python
import matplotlib
matplotlib.use('Agg')          # headless-safe for scripts/CI
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

x = np.random.default_rng(0).normal(size=500)
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.hist(x, bins=30)
ax.set_title('sample distribution')
fig.savefig('hist.png', dpi=120)
print('wrote hist.png')
```

**Remember:** Label the axes. An unlabelled plot is a decoration, not evidence.

**Common mistake:** Judging a model by its accuracy number alone without ever looking at the data.

## 2. Distribution plots: hist, kde, box, violin

Plot before you model. A histogram exposes skew and outliers, a scatter exposes non-linearity, and a line of residuals exposes a model that is systematically wrong. Five minutes of plotting saves hours of confused tuning.

```python
import matplotlib
matplotlib.use('Agg')          # headless-safe for scripts/CI
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

x = np.random.default_rng(0).normal(size=500)
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.hist(x, bins=30)
ax.set_title('sample distribution')
fig.savefig('hist.png', dpi=120)
print('wrote hist.png')
```

## What you should be able to do after Day 12

- Explain **seaborn on top of matplotlib** to someone else without notes.
- Explain **Distribution plots: hist, kde, box, violin** to someone else without notes.
- Explain **Pairplots and correlation heatmaps** to someone else without notes.
- Explain **Categorical comparisons** to someone else without notes.
- Explain **Scatter with hue and size encoding** to someone else without notes.
- Run every file in `examples/` and predict its output before running it.
- Answer `questions.md` before opening `answers.md`.

Now open `examples/`, run each file, then break it on purpose and fix it.
