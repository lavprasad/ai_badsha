## 1. Why standard benchmarks mislead

Vibes do not survive a prompt change. Build a small golden set of real inputs with expected outputs, run it on every change, and track the score. Use an LLM judge for open-ended quality, but calibrate the judge against human ratings first.

```python
GOLDEN = [
    {'input': 'charged twice', 'expect': 'BILLING'},
    {'input': 'crashes on upload', 'expect': 'BUG'},
    {'input': 'please add dark mode', 'expect': 'FEATURE'},
]

def classify(text):                      # stand-in for the real model call
    t = text.lower()
    if 'charg' in t or 'bill' in t:
        return 'BILLING'
    if 'crash' in t or 'error' in t:
        return 'BUG'
    return 'FEATURE'

hits = sum(classify(c['input']) == c['expect'] for c in GOLDEN)
print(f'eval score {hits}/{len(GOLDEN)}')
assert hits == len(GOLDEN), 'regression: fix before shipping'
```

**Remember:** 50 real examples you curated beat 5000 synthetic ones nobody checked.

**Common mistake:** Changing the prompt on Friday with no eval and finding out from customers on Monday.

Practice: open `examples/01_why_standard_benchmarks_mislead.py`, predict the output, change one line, predict again.

## 2. Building a golden dataset

Vibes do not survive a prompt change. Build a small golden set of real inputs with expected outputs, run it on every change, and track the score. Use an LLM judge for open-ended quality, but calibrate the judge against human ratings first.

```python
GOLDEN = [
    {'input': 'charged twice', 'expect': 'BILLING'},
    {'input': 'crashes on upload', 'expect': 'BUG'},
    {'input': 'please add dark mode', 'expect': 'FEATURE'},
]

def classify(text):                      # stand-in for the real model call
    t = text.lower()
    if 'charg' in t or 'bill' in t:
        return 'BILLING'
    if 'crash' in t or 'error' in t:
        return 'BUG'
    return 'FEATURE'

hits = sum(classify(c['input']) == c['expect'] for c in GOLDEN)
print(f'eval score {hits}/{len(GOLDEN)}')
assert hits == len(GOLDEN), 'regression: fix before shipping'
```

**Remember:** 50 real examples you curated beat 5000 synthetic ones nobody checked.

**Common mistake:** Changing the prompt on Friday with no eval and finding out from customers on Monday.

Practice: open `examples/02_building_a_golden_dataset.py`, predict the output, change one line, predict again.

## 3. Task-specific automatic metrics

Vibes do not survive a prompt change. Build a small golden set of real inputs with expected outputs, run it on every change, and track the score. Use an LLM judge for open-ended quality, but calibrate the judge against human ratings first.

```python
GOLDEN = [
    {'input': 'charged twice', 'expect': 'BILLING'},
    {'input': 'crashes on upload', 'expect': 'BUG'},
    {'input': 'please add dark mode', 'expect': 'FEATURE'},
]

def classify(text):                      # stand-in for the real model call
    t = text.lower()
    if 'charg' in t or 'bill' in t:
        return 'BILLING'
    if 'crash' in t or 'error' in t:
        return 'BUG'
    return 'FEATURE'

hits = sum(classify(c['input']) == c['expect'] for c in GOLDEN)
print(f'eval score {hits}/{len(GOLDEN)}')
assert hits == len(GOLDEN), 'regression: fix before shipping'
```

**Remember:** 50 real examples you curated beat 5000 synthetic ones nobody checked.

**Common mistake:** Changing the prompt on Friday with no eval and finding out from customers on Monday.

Practice: open `examples/03_task_specific_automatic_metrics.py`, predict the output, change one line, predict again.

## 4. Exact match and structured checks

Vibes do not survive a prompt change. Build a small golden set of real inputs with expected outputs, run it on every change, and track the score. Use an LLM judge for open-ended quality, but calibrate the judge against human ratings first.

    {'input': 'crashes on upload', 'expect': 'BUG'},
    {'input': 'please add dark mode', 'expect': 'FEATURE'},
]

def classify(text):                      # stand-in for the real model call
    t = text.lower()
    if 'charg' in t or 'bill' in t:
        return 'BILLING'
    if 'crash' in t or 'error' in t:
        return 'BUG'
    return 'FEATURE'

hits = sum(classify(c['input']) == c['expect'] for c in GOLDEN)
print(f'eval score {hits}/{len(GOLDEN)}')
assert hits == len(GOLDEN), 'regression: fix before shipping'
```

**Remember:** 50 real examples you curated beat 5000 synthetic ones nobody checked.

    {'input': 'please add dark mode', 'expect': 'FEATURE'},
]

def classify(text):                      # stand-in for the real model call
    t = text.lower()
    if 'charg' in t or 'bill' in t:
        return 'BILLING'
    if 'crash' in t or 'error' in t:
        return 'BUG'
    return 'FEATURE'

hits = sum(classify(c['input']) == c['expect'] for c in GOLDEN)
print(f'eval score {hits}/{len(GOLDEN)}')
assert hits == len(GOLDEN), 'regression: fix before shipping'
