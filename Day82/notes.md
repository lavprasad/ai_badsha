## 1. Why zero initialisation fails

A vector is a list of numbers with a direction and length. The dot product measures alignment: large and positive when two vectors point the same way, zero when perpendicular. Cosine similarity is the dot product with length divided out, which is why it compares embeddings of different magnitudes fairly.

```python
import numpy as np

a = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
b = np.array([2.0, 4.0, 6.0])

print('dot   ', a @ b)
print('norm  ', np.linalg.norm(a))
cos = (a @ b) / (np.linalg.norm(a) * np.linalg.norm(b))
print('cosine', cos)   # 1.0 -> same direction
```

**Remember:** Cosine similarity ignores magnitude; Euclidean distance does not. Pick the one that matches your question.

**Common mistake:** Comparing raw embeddings with Euclidean distance when only direction carries meaning.

## 2. Random initialisation scale

A vector is a list of numbers with a direction and length. The dot product measures alignment: large and positive when two vectors point the same way, zero when perpendicular. Cosine similarity is the dot product with length divided out, which is why it compares embeddings of different magnitudes fairly.

```python
import numpy as np

a = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
b = np.array([2.0, 4.0, 6.0])

print('dot   ', a @ b)
print('norm  ', np.linalg.norm(a))
cos = (a @ b) / (np.linalg.norm(a) * np.linalg.norm(b))
print('cosine', cos)   # 1.0 -> same direction
```

**Remember:** Cosine similarity ignores magnitude; Euclidean distance does not. Pick the one that matches your question.

**Common mistake:** Comparing raw embeddings with Euclidean distance when only direction carries meaning.

## 3. Xavier/Glorot initialisation

A vector is a list of numbers with a direction and length. The dot product measures alignment: large and positive when two vectors point the same way, zero when perpendicular. Cosine similarity is the dot product with length divided out, which is why it compares embeddings of different magnitudes fairly.

```python
import numpy as np

a = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
b = np.array([2.0, 4.0, 6.0])

print('dot   ', a @ b)
print('norm  ', np.linalg.norm(a))
cos = (a @ b) / (np.linalg.norm(a) * np.linalg.norm(b))
print('cosine', cos)   # 1.0 -> same direction
```

**Remember:** Cosine similarity ignores magnitude; Euclidean distance does not. Pick the one that matches your question.

**Common mistake:** Comparing raw embeddings with Euclidean distance when only direction carries meaning.

## 4. He initialisation for ReLU

A vector is a list of numbers with a direction and length. The dot product measures alignment: large and positive when two vectors point the same way, zero when perpendicular. Cosine similarity is the dot product with length divided out, which is why it compares embeddings of different magnitudes fairly.

b = np.array([2.0, 4.0, 6.0])

print('dot   ', a @ b)
print('norm  ', np.linalg.norm(a))
cos = (a @ b) / (np.linalg.norm(a) * np.linalg.norm(b))

- Explain **Batch normalisation** to someone else without notes.
- Run every file in `examples/` and predict its output before running it.
- Answer `questions.md` before opening `answers.md`.

Now open `examples/`, run each file, then break it on purpose and fix it.
