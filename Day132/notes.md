## 1. Why full fine-tuning is expensive

Hyperparameters are the settings you choose, not learn. Grid search is exhaustive and wasteful; random search finds good regions faster in high dimensions; Bayesian search learns from previous trials. Always search inside cross-validation.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
import numpy as np

X, y = load_breast_cancer(return_X_y=True)
space = {
    'n_estimators': [100, 300, 600],
    'max_depth': [None, 4, 8, 16],
    'min_samples_leaf': [1, 2, 4, 8],
}
search = RandomizedSearchCV(
    RandomForestClassifier(random_state=0, n_jobs=-1),
    space, n_iter=12, cv=5, random_state=0,
).fit(X, y)
print(search.best_params_, round(search.best_score_, 4))
```

**Remember:** Fix the random seed and log every trial, or you cannot reproduce your own best model.

**Common mistake:** Tuning 40 hyperparameters on 400 rows — you are now fitting the validation set.

## 2. Adapters

Hyperparameters are the settings you choose, not learn. Grid search is exhaustive and wasteful; random search finds good regions faster in high dimensions; Bayesian search learns from previous trials. Always search inside cross-validation.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
import numpy as np

X, y = load_breast_cancer(return_X_y=True)
space = {
    'n_estimators': [100, 300, 600],
    'max_depth': [None, 4, 8, 16],
    'min_samples_leaf': [1, 2, 4, 8],
}
search = RandomizedSearchCV(
    RandomForestClassifier(random_state=0, n_jobs=-1),
    space, n_iter=12, cv=5, random_state=0,
).fit(X, y)
print(search.best_params_, round(search.best_score_, 4))
```

**Remember:** Fix the random seed and log every trial, or you cannot reproduce your own best model.

**Common mistake:** Tuning 40 hyperparameters on 400 rows — you are now fitting the validation set.

    RandomForestClassifier(random_state=0, n_jobs=-1),
    space, n_iter=12, cv=5, random_state=0,

- Explain **Why full fine-tuning is expensive** to someone else without notes.
- Explain **Adapters** to someone else without notes.
- Explain **LoRA: the low-rank idea** to someone else without notes.
- Explain **Rank, alpha and target modules** to someone else without notes.
- Explain **QLoRA and 4-bit base weights** to someone else without notes.
- Run every file in `examples/` and predict its output before running it.
- Answer `questions.md` before opening `answers.md`.

Now open `examples/`, run each file, then break it on purpose and fix it.
