## 1. The bottleneck problem in seq2seq

Attention lets every token look at every other token and decide what matters. Each token emits a query, a key and a value; the query-key dot products become weights over the values. Multiple heads let the model attend to several relationships at once.

```python
import numpy as np

def softmax(z):
    z = z - z.max(axis=-1, keepdims=True)
    e = np.exp(z)
    return e / e.sum(axis=-1, keepdims=True)

rng = np.random.default_rng(0)
seq, d = 4, 8
Q, K, V = (rng.normal(size=(seq, d)) for _ in range(3))

scores = Q @ K.T / np.sqrt(d)             # scale keeps softmax out of saturation
mask = np.triu(np.ones((seq, seq)), k=1) * -1e9   # causal: no peeking ahead
weights = softmax(scores + mask)
print(weights.round(3))
print('output shape', (weights @ V).shape)
```

**Remember:** The 1/sqrt(d) scale is not cosmetic — without it softmax saturates and gradients die.

**Common mistake:** Omitting the causal mask in a decoder, so the model trivially cheats by reading the next token.

Practice: open `examples/01_the_bottleneck_problem_in_seq2seq.py`, predict the output, change one line, predict again.

## 2. Attention as weighted lookup

Attention lets every token look at every other token and decide what matters. Each token emits a query, a key and a value; the query-key dot products become weights over the values. Multiple heads let the model attend to several relationships at once.

```python
import numpy as np

def softmax(z):
    z = z - z.max(axis=-1, keepdims=True)
    e = np.exp(z)
    return e / e.sum(axis=-1, keepdims=True)

rng = np.random.default_rng(0)
seq, d = 4, 8
Q, K, V = (rng.normal(size=(seq, d)) for _ in range(3))

scores = Q @ K.T / np.sqrt(d)             # scale keeps softmax out of saturation
mask = np.triu(np.ones((seq, seq)), k=1) * -1e9   # causal: no peeking ahead
weights = softmax(scores + mask)
print(weights.round(3))
print('output shape', (weights @ V).shape)
```

**Remember:** The 1/sqrt(d) scale is not cosmetic — without it softmax saturates and gradients die.

**Common mistake:** Omitting the causal mask in a decoder, so the model trivially cheats by reading the next token.

Practice: open `examples/02_attention_as_weighted_lookup.py`, predict the output, change one line, predict again.

## 3. Query, key and value

Attention lets every token look at every other token and decide what matters. Each token emits a query, a key and a value; the query-key dot products become weights over the values. Multiple heads let the model attend to several relationships at once.

```python
import numpy as np

def softmax(z):
    z = z - z.max(axis=-1, keepdims=True)
    e = np.exp(z)
    return e / e.sum(axis=-1, keepdims=True)

rng = np.random.default_rng(0)
seq, d = 4, 8
Q, K, V = (rng.normal(size=(seq, d)) for _ in range(3))

scores = Q @ K.T / np.sqrt(d)             # scale keeps softmax out of saturation
mask = np.triu(np.ones((seq, seq)), k=1) * -1e9   # causal: no peeking ahead
weights = softmax(scores + mask)
print(weights.round(3))
print('output shape', (weights @ V).shape)
```

**Remember:** The 1/sqrt(d) scale is not cosmetic — without it softmax saturates and gradients die.

**Common mistake:** Omitting the causal mask in a decoder, so the model trivially cheats by reading the next token.

Practice: open `examples/03_query_key_and_value.py`, predict the output, change one line, predict again.

## 4. Scaled dot-product attention

Attention lets every token look at every other token and decide what matters. Each token emits a query, a key and a value; the query-key dot products become weights over the values. Multiple heads let the model attend to several relationships at once.

```python
import numpy as np

def softmax(z):
    z = z - z.max(axis=-1, keepdims=True)
    e = np.exp(z)
    return e / e.sum(axis=-1, keepdims=True)

rng = np.random.default_rng(0)
seq, d = 4, 8
Q, K, V = (rng.normal(size=(seq, d)) for _ in range(3))

scores = Q @ K.T / np.sqrt(d)             # scale keeps softmax out of saturation
mask = np.triu(np.ones((seq, seq)), k=1) * -1e9   # causal: no peeking ahead
weights = softmax(scores + mask)
print(weights.round(3))
print('output shape', (weights @ V).shape)
```

**Remember:** The 1/sqrt(d) scale is not cosmetic — without it softmax saturates and gradients die.

**Common mistake:** Omitting the causal mask in a decoder, so the model trivially cheats by reading the next token.

Practice: open `examples/04_scaled_dot_product_attention.py`, predict the output, change one line, predict again.

## 5. The scaling factor and why it matters

Attention lets every token look at every other token and decide what matters. Each token emits a query, a key and a value; the query-key dot products become weights over the values. Multiple heads let the model attend to several relationships at once.

```python
import numpy as np

def softmax(z):
    z = z - z.max(axis=-1, keepdims=True)
    e = np.exp(z)
    return e / e.sum(axis=-1, keepdims=True)

rng = np.random.default_rng(0)
seq, d = 4, 8
Q, K, V = (rng.normal(size=(seq, d)) for _ in range(3))

scores = Q @ K.T / np.sqrt(d)             # scale keeps softmax out of saturation
mask = np.triu(np.ones((seq, seq)), k=1) * -1e9   # causal: no peeking ahead
weights = softmax(scores + mask)
print(weights.round(3))
print('output shape', (weights @ V).shape)
```

**Remember:** The 1/sqrt(d) scale is not cosmetic — without it softmax saturates and gradients die.

**Common mistake:** Omitting the causal mask in a decoder, so the model trivially cheats by reading the next token.

Practice: open `examples/05_the_scaling_factor_and_why_it_matters.py`, predict the output, change one line, predict again.

## 6. Attention masks

Attention lets every token look at every other token and decide what matters. Each token emits a query, a key and a value; the query-key dot products become weights over the values. Multiple heads let the model attend to several relationships at once.

```python
import numpy as np

def softmax(z):
    z = z - z.max(axis=-1, keepdims=True)
    e = np.exp(z)
    return e / e.sum(axis=-1, keepdims=True)

rng = np.random.default_rng(0)
seq, d = 4, 8
Q, K, V = (rng.normal(size=(seq, d)) for _ in range(3))

scores = Q @ K.T / np.sqrt(d)             # scale keeps softmax out of saturation
mask = np.triu(np.ones((seq, seq)), k=1) * -1e9   # causal: no peeking ahead
weights = softmax(scores + mask)
print(weights.round(3))
print('output shape', (weights @ V).shape)
```

**Remember:** The 1/sqrt(d) scale is not cosmetic — without it softmax saturates and gradients die.

**Common mistake:** Omitting the causal mask in a decoder, so the model trivially cheats by reading the next token.

Practice: open `examples/06_attention_masks.py`, predict the output, change one line, predict again.

## 7. Self-attention vs cross-attention

Attention lets every token look at every other token and decide what matters. Each token emits a query, a key and a value; the query-key dot products become weights over the values. Multiple heads let the model attend to several relationships at once.

```python
import numpy as np

def softmax(z):
    z = z - z.max(axis=-1, keepdims=True)
    e = np.exp(z)
    return e / e.sum(axis=-1, keepdims=True)

rng = np.random.default_rng(0)
seq, d = 4, 8
Q, K, V = (rng.normal(size=(seq, d)) for _ in range(3))

scores = Q @ K.T / np.sqrt(d)             # scale keeps softmax out of saturation
mask = np.triu(np.ones((seq, seq)), k=1) * -1e9   # causal: no peeking ahead
weights = softmax(scores + mask)
print(weights.round(3))
print('output shape', (weights @ V).shape)
```

**Remember:** The 1/sqrt(d) scale is not cosmetic — without it softmax saturates and gradients die.

**Common mistake:** Omitting the causal mask in a decoder, so the model trivially cheats by reading the next token.

Practice: open `examples/07_self_attention_vs_cross_attention.py`, predict the output, change one line, predict again.

## 8. Multi-head attention

Attention lets every token look at every other token and decide what matters. Each token emits a query, a key and a value; the query-key dot products become weights over the values. Multiple heads let the model attend to several relationships at once.

```python
import numpy as np

def softmax(z):
    z = z - z.max(axis=-1, keepdims=True)
    e = np.exp(z)
    return e / e.sum(axis=-1, keepdims=True)

rng = np.random.default_rng(0)
seq, d = 4, 8
Q, K, V = (rng.normal(size=(seq, d)) for _ in range(3))

scores = Q @ K.T / np.sqrt(d)             # scale keeps softmax out of saturation
mask = np.triu(np.ones((seq, seq)), k=1) * -1e9   # causal: no peeking ahead
weights = softmax(scores + mask)
print(weights.round(3))
print('output shape', (weights @ V).shape)
```

**Remember:** The 1/sqrt(d) scale is not cosmetic — without it softmax saturates and gradients die.

**Common mistake:** Omitting the causal mask in a decoder, so the model trivially cheats by reading the next token.

Practice: open `examples/08_multi_head_attention.py`, predict the output, change one line, predict again.

## 9. Attention weight visualisation

Plot before you model. A histogram exposes skew and outliers, a scatter exposes non-linearity, and a line of residuals exposes a model that is systematically wrong. Five minutes of plotting saves hours of confused tuning.

```python
import matplotlib
matplotlib.use('Agg')          # headless-safe for scripts/CI
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

x = np.random.default_rng(0).normal(size=500)
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.hist(x, bins=30)
ax.set_title('sample distribution')
fig.savefig('hist.png', dpi=120)
print('wrote hist.png')
```

**Remember:** Label the axes. An unlabelled plot is a decoration, not evidence.

**Common mistake:** Judging a model by its accuracy number alone without ever looking at the data.

Practice: open `examples/09_attention_weight_visualisation.py`, predict the output, change one line, predict again.

## 10. Implementing attention in NumPy

Attention lets every token look at every other token and decide what matters. Each token emits a query, a key and a value; the query-key dot products become weights over the values. Multiple heads let the model attend to several relationships at once.

```python
import numpy as np

def softmax(z):
    z = z - z.max(axis=-1, keepdims=True)
    e = np.exp(z)
    return e / e.sum(axis=-1, keepdims=True)

rng = np.random.default_rng(0)
seq, d = 4, 8
Q, K, V = (rng.normal(size=(seq, d)) for _ in range(3))

scores = Q @ K.T / np.sqrt(d)             # scale keeps softmax out of saturation
mask = np.triu(np.ones((seq, seq)), k=1) * -1e9   # causal: no peeking ahead
weights = softmax(scores + mask)
print(weights.round(3))
print('output shape', (weights @ V).shape)
```

**Remember:** The 1/sqrt(d) scale is not cosmetic — without it softmax saturates and gradients die.

**Common mistake:** Omitting the causal mask in a decoder, so the model trivially cheats by reading the next token.

Practice: open `examples/10_implementing_attention_in_numpy.py`, predict the output, change one line, predict again.
